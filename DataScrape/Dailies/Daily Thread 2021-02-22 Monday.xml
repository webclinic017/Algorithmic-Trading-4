   <body>Repost from weekend thread since I put at least 5 mins effort into this: 

Hopefully some bounce on EV plays early next week!

LKE looks poised - may look to grab some more with the market continuing to anticipate the NVX test announcement. Still huge volume on the ASX and on the OTC markets - love this bad boy.

CXO could really use a bounce - can‚Äôt see it below the cap raise price (25c) for much longer. It should have some support here (hopefully) - doubling down could be on the cards for me.

Considering consolidating my manganese plays into just E25 - their latest presso looks absolutely prime

On a non EV front - DW8 saved me from big blushes late last week and hopefully it can continue. Probably my favourite growth stonk

PEN bouncing violently off 14 on Fri arvo was a thing of beauty - hopefully we get some tailwind from the new OTC listing and spring to a higher high. Nice volume on it so far on the new OTC listing - ASX investors are still frothing it too which is nice to see.

I was bringing people‚Äôs attention to it a couple weeks ago but now it‚Äôs for real - tin prices are mooning with futures up 11% last week. With the upcoming electronics boom, Myanmar coup (3rd largest tin producer) and current tiny supply levels - it would be an absolute travesty if we didn‚Äôt see some significant pump on some ASX tin plays. SRZ and VMS worth a look imo for speccy big upside. Will be slapping the ask on Mon.

RBL - get me the fuck out hahaha. MS established a sub holding at high $5s late last week post the results dump so I‚Äôm hanging my hat on that for now. Need the volume to sustain into next week and hopefully cash out toward mid-6s.

BOL DYOR etc. Moon soon üöÄ</body>

    <body>Why are you bearish on RBL? Last results looked good plus Biden stimulus in coming soon which means more money for consumers to spend on e-commerce sites. Plus a positive buy rating from GS. What am I missing?</body>

     <body>Results are fine - they don‚Äôt justify soaring to new heights though by any means in my opinion.  I don‚Äôt see this next half being close to this - results seemed bloated with high margin mask sales in Q1. Personally was hoping for 55ish million EBIT. Q2 being lower than Q1 despite Halloween, Cyber Monday and Christmas was pretty disappointing I gotta say. The 12 month $7.11 price target from GS seems extremely reasonable. Wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm bearish - I think you can make money by buying around here but I‚Äôm not optimistic about pumping anywhere near as hard as last year</body>

    <body>E25 is solid. Been slowly adding since December.

Basically;
-starting production next few weeks
-great growth plan- plenty of upside with high purity manganese (green thanks to CSIRO and long term renewable power plans)
-low SOI- through low dilution and some shrewd investments.
-Low MC v stage 2 NPV.

They've gone from explorer to producer inside 12 months. I was fairly skeptical after watching their earlier Crux interviews but they've delivered.</body>

     <body>Just looked at E25. Very interesting but i dont have to time to plow through all info atm. 
Stage 1 is going to be completed in Q1 this year and i believe already has offtake for 100%. The npv is 500m for just stage 1 but MC does not seem to reflect this even though project is heavily derisked, what is suppressing the SP?

What is the ebit that will be generated from stage 1?

How likely can they produce high purity Manganese for battery use?</body>
     <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="BeagleJools" created="2021-02-22 02:28:34+10:00">
      <body>Not sure why the sp is suppressed. As for the ebit, we'll find out over the next two quarters. It'll supposedly pay for stage 2.
They've stated in interviews that high purity manganese can be generated more environmentally friendly and cheaper than China. They're really starting to push their green credentials now and there will be a PFS out for this later this year. I'm optimistic given what they've achieved so far.</body>

    <body>Do you think AVZ gets overlooked as a tin speccie? Potentially 3rd largest Tin resource in the world and currently being confirmed with drill assays.

AVZ major resource and future revenue will mainly come from lithium (spodumene) and may pose a socioeconomic risk as the mine will be built in the DRC. 

Once Tin offtakes and future lithium offtakes are announced, this will signifcantly derisk the projects and with AVZ being in a great position purely based on having both tin and lithium prices flying-to me it seems there is alot of money to be made.

Not sure if people are sleeping on this company or if investors are waiting for signifcant derisking announcements like offtake ane final investment decisions.</body>

   <body>XST/SGC -

Either I'm missing something or people are misunderstanding what is happening with XST/SGC. The Borba 1-7 well is not the end of the story, its the start and we haven't even started drilling yet. It was always intended that Borba 1-7 would "open-up" a greater TCF play. I don't think a multi tcf single well was ever on the cards. If you look at the earlier Dempsey prospect, it was always touted as a 1+TCF play and they ended up spudding multiple wells.

You'll note that the resource report (which is usually conservative in its numbers) shows a 70% chance of success with the company indicating it expects an 80% chance of development - these numbers are high. 

Going off what the company director is saying there will be more spuds happening after this one (which we're still yet to get results from). From here there should be plenty of announcements coming through in the next 30 days or so from actual drilling results. 

Now, I'm always hesitant to try to calculate the worth of something like a natural gas well as I'm not a geologist and there's probably more to it than just taking the amount of gas and multiplying it by the price of gas, but doing so gives the below results: 

Gas price avg = A$5/Mcf (thousand cubic feet) 

XST/SGC split = 38/75 Bcf  

XST share in $ = A$190 million (MC of 32 mil) 

SGC share in $ = A$375 million (MC of 40 mil) 

This is for 1 well. 

Potentially there is more that I'm not seeing but it seems to me that even off the Borba 1-7 well, the SP should grow substantially for both companies once they actually start making money off these wells.

Please let me know if there is something wrong with my math or any massive inaccuracies in what I've said.

Edit: As expected, my math is off. They have 70% CoS for 10.3/19.5Bcf respectively. Recalculated, this gives $51.5 mil and $97.5 mil. These numbers still seem pretty good at their current MC's.</body>
   <comment ups="10" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-02-21 21:40:28+10:00">
    <body>You‚Äôre using the wrong numbers from the report. It‚Äôs actually a 70% chance of 19.5bcf for SGC and 10.3bcf for XST - see page 5 of SGC‚Äôs report and page 3 of XST‚Äôs. 

You have to use these numbers because these are the numbers that account for the different layers. The higher numbers aren‚Äôt adjusted for the probability of each layer. 

The 141bcf total figure is the total for all layers ignoring the fact that each layer has its own probability of success. It‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äú70% chance of 141bcf‚Äù and despite what you read on here and HC the report doesn‚Äôt actually say that.

A lot of people think the report is overly conservative and that may or may not be right, but if you‚Äôre going to do the sums based on the report at least use the right figures.</body>

     <body>Ahh okay, that makes sense. So essentially its saying they have a 70% chance of recovering $51.5 mil (XST)/97.5 mil (SGC) worth of gas each. I've had a look at other resource reports and it seems that 70% CoS is quite high. 

What do you make of future drills in this area? The MD seems very bullish on it. It seems that this is kind of a proof of concept to show that there is recoverable gas in this area.</body>
     <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-02-21 21:59:51+10:00">
      <body>I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think. I‚Äôve got a small amount of SCG that I‚Äôm willing to lose if it‚Äôs a duster, and I‚Äôm just going to let the drilling speak for itself.

People have a lot of strong options either way so I‚Äôm done speculating on Borba. I‚Äôm just locked and loaded. I only wanted to correct your numbers so that you knew better what you were looking at.</body>
      <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="choomby93" created="2021-02-21 22:04:15+10:00">
       <body>Yeah its for sure a high risk play - i think peoples expectations for the resource report were a bit unrealistic. I've got small amounts in both and happy to hold through drill results. Cheers for the correction!</body>
       <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-02-21 22:13:47+10:00">
        <body>I‚Äôll also add that no one really knows what‚Äôs down there - even the independent expert. Could be more could be less could be nothing. 

So a big success could involve more than the predicted bcf each - but there‚Äôs only one way to find out and anything else is true speculation at this point!</body>

    <body>Hey mate, just a quick pointer - although it's easy to just calculate the gross estimated gas by current gas prices - the reality is, is that it's not free to pump out. Try using the net present value formula to expense out the cost of production and to ensure that it's economical.</body>

   <body>Been accumulating more TLG. Currently the only and possibly the largest graphite resource with vertically integrated anode production in Europe ‚Äì where EV transition will be spearheaded. Tier-1 mining jurisdiction in Sweden. 

Anode/graphite material makes up a large volume/weight of the Lithium-ion battery but has generally been the less talk of all battery materials even though demand is also projected to eclipse supply. BUT recently there has been a strong increase in interest and price actions across all Graphite/Anode players. Some Graphite stocks in the US has been going gangbuster. TLG is well set up to take advantage of this being the potentially largest graphite/anode player in Europe. Someone going to need to supply the demand‚Ä¶outside China.

DFS for the ‚Äòinitial‚Äô 20k tpa anode production (NOT graphite but anode material) expected in March 2021 and that should result in price action, follow by hopefully binding JV with LKAB (Swedish mining company) and Mitsui. Further scoping study has been done to potentially increase this production up to 100k tpa.

   <body>Got in NNG on Friday, IPO on Thursday and closed Friday 40% up from IPO price of $0.20.

Reasons

 - price held up well above Thursday's close despite XJO was in deep red on Friday. I took this as a sign of holders not letting go of their shares at current level and have high confidence 

- buy/sell depth added conviction to the above observation 

- about 45% of total 111mil SOI held by top holders and are in escrow, so about 63mil shares to trade on market, relatively small float.

- stock in tech space, I bet on its growth potential to be overvalued in a short term once it was promoted by some stock news websites/caught public's attention

- if it didn't go well, I have the $0.265 wall to sell into, so about 4% downside


During the weekend, I saw QPM and its chart, and now I believe that would've been a better hold over the weekend.

Reasons

- break out of previous resistances on high volume, closed Friday at ATH

- announcement from last week would likely be used as hype fuel

- closed $0.088, if it makes 10%, there's a chance that the momentum will push it above $0.10 and the pip change will take it up further

- the 500% gains mania in last week may have not ended and QPM looks to have similar recipe to those that was pumped to 500%

- I'll see how this open and decide whether to jump in</body>

     <body>You'll be fine if you hold. I was in the red by a lot for months, now I'm way up. They're an underrated company, but at the end of the day the market does as it does. 

I think a good report on 25/02 is already priced in, but news on ADRs and/or substantial US investor would send it higher.</body>

       <body>My money is in LGP, plenty of positives to read into and good future plans.

It's only problem is that it's playing too aggressive. Yearly spending is just about doubling every year. I can't see it being profitable for a while though it's definitely starting to do some good deals.

So it's gamble - if they start making serious money to offset what they spend üöÄüöÄüöÄ.
If not, well they'll get the money by diluting you back to the stoner age.</body>

  <body>The quality of this sub unfortunately has finally hit a wall. 

The number of newbies "giving advice" is watering down the sub.

Whilst I respect what the mods have done to prevent spamming, some of you new users have to understand that if you're ever going to get good at this, you gotta do your time and figure out your strategy.

If you can't read financials, can't read charts, don't know very common trading terms, don't understand why some stocks are hyped up in the first place (often intentionally) or even worse, don't even how to use Google, don't expect this to be fun.

If you're just blindly following random posts and buying stocks without even knowing what the company does, you're literally a sheep that some more experienced lads want to prey on. 

Sure some of you will get lucky and get a bagger or more easy (first one's always free).

But how you react when your investment turns on you will be more interesting for the rest of us honestly. 

You want good advice? Invest what you're willing to lose and this is especially true if it's a risky trade. If that number is $2K for example and that disappears, it shouldn't bother you too much because you knew the risk from the start. 

Why? Because that's my favourite part of trading. If I fuck up, that's on me. But if my analysis is right, I win. 

That's really it.</body>

It‚Äôs unbelievable how many posts I‚Äôve seen the mods delete asking just basic questions or posting the same shit posted already even that day. Sad to see the quality of this great sub diminish.

  <body>I spent the weekend using the recent ‚Äòhow to‚Äô post by u/yothuyindi (thanks man) to compare approx 30 companies and rate them according to the factors discussed. Also looked at the diversity of the management and directors and whether I thought the CEO‚Äôs got paid too much relative to market cap and performance. I have come to a short list which I just have to dive into a little bit more. I could possibly be applying biases in my ratings in order to get the results I am after but so long as I‚Äôm confident that‚Äôs all that matters :) I‚Äôll share my decisions and reasoning this week maybe get help with any mistakes. 

Interesting how much my opinion of a company changes when I find out how much the ceo does or doesn‚Äôt pay themself. One of my top watchlist stocks would picks be ruled out because I‚Äôm disappointed with the CEO pay. Unless I can find something that makes up for it somewhere.</body>

  <body>XST/SGC -

Either I'm missing something or people are misunderstanding what is happening with XST/SGC. The Borba 1-7 well is not the end of the story, its the start and we haven't even started drilling yet. It was always intended that Borba 1-7 would "open-up" a greater TCF play. I don't think a multi tcf single well was ever on the cards. If you look at the earlier Dempsey prospect, it was always touted as a 1+TCF play and they ended up spudding multiple wells.

You'll note that the resource report (which is usually conservative in its numbers) shows a 70% chance of success with the company indicating it expects an 80% chance of development - these numbers are high. 

Going off what the company director is saying there will be more spuds happening after this one (which we're still yet to get results from). From here there should be plenty of announcements coming through in the next 30 days or so from actual drilling results. 

Now, I'm always hesitant to try to calculate the worth of something like a natural gas well as I'm not a geologist and there's probably more to it than just taking the amount of gas and multiplying it by the price of gas, but doing so gives the below results: 

Gas price avg = A$5/Mcf (thousand cubic feet) 

XST/SGC split = 38/75 Bcf  

XST share in $ = A$190 million (MC of 32 mil) 

SGC share in $ = A$375 million (MC of 40 mil) 

This is for 1 well. 

Potentially there is more that I'm not seeing but it seems to me that even off the Borba 1-7 well, the SP should grow substantially for both companies once they actually start making money off these wells.

Please let me know if there is something wrong with my math or any massive inaccuracies in what I've said.

Edit: As expected, my math is off. They have 70% CoS for 10.3/19.5Bcf respectively. Recalculated, this gives $51.5 mil and $97.5 mil. These numbers still seem pretty good at their current MC's.</body>
  <comment ups="10" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-02-21 21:40:28+10:00">
   <body>You‚Äôre using the wrong numbers from the report. It‚Äôs actually a 70% chance of 19.5bcf for SGC and 10.3bcf for XST - see page 5 of SGC‚Äôs report and page 3 of XST‚Äôs. 

You have to use these numbers because these are the numbers that account for the different layers. The higher numbers aren‚Äôt adjusted for the probability of each layer. 

The 141bcf total figure is the total for all layers ignoring the fact that each layer has its own probability of success. It‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äú70% chance of 141bcf‚Äù and despite what you read on here and HC the report doesn‚Äôt actually say that.

A lot of people think the report is overly conservative and that may or may not be right, but if you‚Äôre going to do the sums based on the report at least use the right figures.</body>
   <comment ups="7" downs="0" author="choomby93" created="2021-02-21 21:53:43+10:00">
    <body>Ahh okay, that makes sense. So essentially its saying they have a 70% chance of recovering $51.5 mil (XST)/97.5 mil (SGC) worth of gas each. I've had a look at other resource reports and it seems that 70% CoS is quite high. 

What do you make of future drills in this area? The MD seems very bullish on it. It seems that this is kind of a proof of concept to show that there is recoverable gas in this area.</body>
    <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-02-21 21:59:51+10:00">
     <body>I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think. I‚Äôve got a small amount of SCG that I‚Äôm willing to lose if it‚Äôs a duster, and I‚Äôm just going to let the drilling speak for itself.

People have a lot of strong options either way so I‚Äôm done speculating on Borba. I‚Äôm just locked and loaded. I only wanted to correct your numbers so that you knew better what you were looking at.</body>
     <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="choomby93" created="2021-02-21 22:04:15+10:00">
      <body>Yeah its for sure a high risk play - i think peoples expectations for the resource report were a bit unrealistic. I've got small amounts in both and happy to hold through drill results. Cheers for the correction!</body>
      <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-02-21 22:13:47+10:00">
       <body>I‚Äôll also add that no one really knows what‚Äôs down there - even the independent expert. Could be more could be less could be nothing. 

So a big success could involve more than the predicted bcf each - but there‚Äôs only one way to find out and anything else is true speculation at this point!</body>

   <body>Hey mate, just a quick pointer - although it's easy to just calculate the gross estimated gas by current gas prices - the reality is, is that it's not free to pump out. Try using the net present value formula to expense out the cost of production and to ensure that it's economical.</body>

    <body>Different style of project, different type of rare earth deposit. 
LYC is hard rock, it‚Äôs higher grade but more expensive to process and refine and ultimately less profitable per kg. They have already invested billions getting it to this stage 

IXR is ionic clay, you essentially just lightly treat the ore to separate the REE. Easier processing means MUCH lower capex, and ultimately higher returns. It‚Äôs also going to be a monster resource life beyond 25-30yrs.

  <body>Uranium fam ‚ò¢‚ò¢‚ò¢ 

Its gonna be a better week! Monday should be green for most. The Global X Uranium ETF was up 3.3% when trading in the US on Friday. 

Hopefully this translates to a good start. But honestly- the ASX is almost as autist as us so who the fuck knows.</body>

    <body>Super interested in nuclear power as I believe it the best way to reduce CO2 but even if the laws change it will likely be many years before there are active plants here imo.

Not convinced it will be a huge boom for uranium though as nuclear power plants don't use that much uranium really (I know it takes more raw uranium to enrich to 3-20% U235), more interested in what else would boom from nuclear power.

I expect they will use foreign companies to construct plants/enrichment facilities? and do you think the plants will be publicly or privately run?</body>

  <body>Repost from weekend thread since I put at least 5 mins effort into this: 

Hopefully some bounce on EV plays early next week!

LKE looks poised - may look to grab some more with the market continuing to anticipate the NVX test announcement. Still huge volume on the ASX and on the OTC markets - love this bad boy.

CXO could really use a bounce - can‚Äôt see it below the cap raise price (25c) for much longer. It should have some support here (hopefully) - doubling down could be on the cards for me.

Considering consolidating my manganese plays into just E25 - their latest presso looks absolutely prime

On a non EV front - DW8 saved me from big blushes late last week and hopefully it can continue. Probably my favourite growth stonk

PEN bouncing violently off 14 on Fri arvo was a thing of beauty - hopefully we get some tailwind from the new OTC listing and spring to a higher high. Nice volume on it so far on the new OTC listing - ASX investors are still frothing it too which is nice to see.

I was bringing people‚Äôs attention to it a couple weeks ago but now it‚Äôs for real - tin prices are mooning with futures up 11% last week. With the upcoming electronics boom, Myanmar coup (3rd largest tin producer) and current tiny supply levels - it would be an absolute travesty if we didn‚Äôt see some significant pump on some ASX tin plays. SRZ and VMS worth a look imo for speccy big upside. Will be slapping the ask on Mon.

RBL - get me the fuck out hahaha. MS established a sub holding at high $5s late last week post the results dump so I‚Äôm hanging my hat on that for now. Need the volume to sustain into next week and hopefully cash out toward mid-6s.

BOL DYOR etc. Moon soon üöÄ</body>
  <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="Atmo_" created="2021-02-21 21:21:31+10:00">
   <body>Why are you bearish on RBL? Last results looked good plus Biden stimulus in coming soon which means more money for consumers to spend on e-commerce sites. Plus a positive buy rating from GS. What am I missing?</body>
   <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="borkdpasito" created="2021-02-21 21:29:43+10:00">
    <body>Results are fine - they don‚Äôt justify soaring to new heights though by any means in my opinion.  I don‚Äôt see this next half being close to this - results seemed bloated with high margin mask sales in Q1. Personally was hoping for 55ish million EBIT. Q2 being lower than Q1 despite Halloween, Cyber Monday and Christmas was pretty disappointing I gotta say. The 12 month $7.11 price target from GS seems extremely reasonable. Wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm bearish - I think you can make money by buying around here but I‚Äôm not optimistic about pumping anywhere near as hard as last year</body>

   <body>E25 is solid. Been slowly adding since December.

Basically;
-starting production next few weeks
-great growth plan- plenty of upside with high purity manganese (green thanks to CSIRO and long term renewable power plans)
-low SOI- through low dilution and some shrewd investments.
-Low MC v stage 2 NPV.

They've gone from explorer to producer inside 12 months. I was fairly skeptical after watching their earlier Crux interviews but they've delivered.</body>

    <body>Just looked at E25. Very interesting but i dont have to time to plow through all info atm. 
Stage 1 is going to be completed in Q1 this year and i believe already has offtake for 100%. The npv is 500m for just stage 1 but MC does not seem to reflect this even though project is heavily derisked, what is suppressing the SP?

What is the ebit that will be generated from stage 1?

How likely can they produce high purity Manganese for battery use?</body>
    <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="BeagleJools" created="2021-02-22 02:28:34+10:00">
     <body>Not sure why the sp is suppressed. As for the ebit, we'll find out over the next two quarters. It'll supposedly pay for stage 2.
They've stated in interviews that high purity manganese can be generated more environmentally friendly and cheaper than China. They're really starting to push their green credentials now and there will be a PFS out for this later this year. I'm optimistic given what they've achieved so far.</body>

   <body>Do you think AVZ gets overlooked as a tin speccie? Potentially 3rd largest Tin resource in the world and currently being confirmed with drill assays.

AVZ major resource and future revenue will mainly come from lithium (spodumene) and may pose a socioeconomic risk as the mine will be built in the DRC. 

Once Tin offtakes and future lithium offtakes are announced, this will signifcantly derisk the projects and with AVZ being in a great position purely based on having both tin and lithium prices flying-to me it seems there is alot of money to be made.

Not sure if people are sleeping on this company or if investors are waiting for signifcant derisking announcements like offtake ane final investment decisions.</body>

  <body>Been accumulating more TLG. Currently the only and possibly the largest graphite resource with vertically integrated anode production in Europe ‚Äì where EV transition will be spearheaded. Tier-1 mining jurisdiction in Sweden. 

Anode/graphite material makes up a large volume/weight of the Lithium-ion battery but has generally been the less talk of all battery materials even though demand is also projected to eclipse supply. BUT recently there has been a strong increase in interest and price actions across all Graphite/Anode players. Some Graphite stocks in the US has been going gangbuster. TLG is well set up to take advantage of this being the potentially largest graphite/anode player in Europe. Someone going to need to supply the demand‚Ä¶outside China.

DFS for the ‚Äòinitial‚Äô 20k tpa anode production (NOT graphite but anode material) expected in March 2021 and that should result in price action, follow by hopefully binding JV with LKAB (Swedish mining company) and Mitsui. Further scoping study has been done to potentially increase this production up to 100k tpa. 

Anyway, obligatory rockets  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ</body>

   <body>I‚Äôve got such high hopes for TLG. If they do what they plan to it‚Äôs easily a 10 bagger from here. Still risk in execution of the plans but huge potential payoff.

   <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="clueaboutmeaning" created="2021-02-21 19:54:55+10:00">
    <body>Yes. It‚Äôs unlikely to drop lower than that since *I think* they handed out a shit load at that price not too long ago. They‚Äôve been in the $1.50 - 1.60 noose for a while now. According to HC , It‚Äôs a popular shorted stock atm.</body>

  <body>So the latest small cap I've become intrigued by over the past week is **CGO**:

[https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/cgo](https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/cgo)

They provide IT systems and services mainly to the banking industry with revenue that's gone from $12.1 million over a *full year* to $18.1 mill in a *half year*, and 3 years straight of increasing profit... from $0.9 million profit the full previous year to $3 million profit in the last 6 months; "*Net Profit after tax attributable to members up 159.8%."*

Also growing in the US.

One I'll be keeping a close eye on, hopefully SP will drop down a little after its really strong report last week and then I may look to buy in.</body>

I agree with you we will recover quicker but it would be very ugly still we would also lose out big time on trade and your exactly right that would lead to much heavier Australian reliance on communist China.

    <body>Old saying, when America sneezes, Australia will catch a cold. Basically talking how close we are tied together, however our markets are radically different and this was shown in the 2008 GFC, but your summation is pretty much right, except for the China part IMO. I think China is getting desperate as they have been burning their economy hard for the last 20 years, whether it's resources or labour, i do think they have another 10 or so years to consolidate their power. But China is China and i could be 100% wrong.</body>

Just my gut instinct talking, but I think that this bubble will continue to grow for at least 6 more months, even a year or 2. I'm guessing everyone just expects the that the ASX will bounce back really fast like the GFC and last year's crash, that it doesn't really bother us as much now.</body>

* Broker EPS forecast: FY21 85.5c, FY22 60.3c, FY23 46.0c.
* They do have green energy assets and gas power plants, but 85.7% of their power generation FY20 came from coal power. 
* 1 of their 3 coal plants is being shut down next year (Liddell). 
* They are paying 100% of their profit into dividends next couple of years (Don't seem to be investing in future).

There might be a deep value play at the end of this long train to hell, but I suggest you do some serious DD before chasing bad money.

  <body>Got in NNG on Friday, IPO on Thursday and closed Friday 40% up from IPO price of $0.20.

Reasons

 - price held up well above Thursday's close despite XJO was in deep red on Friday. I took this as a sign of holders not letting go of their shares at current level and have high confidence 

- buy/sell depth added conviction to the above observation 

- about 45% of total 111mil SOI held by top holders and are in escrow, so about 63mil shares to trade on market, relatively small float.

- stock in tech space, I bet on its growth potential to be overvalued in a short term once it was promoted by some stock news websites/caught public's attention

- if it didn't go well, I have the $0.265 wall to sell into, so about 4% downside


During the weekend, I saw QPM and its chart, and now I believe that would've been a better hold over the weekend.

Reasons

- break out of previous resistances on high volume, closed Friday at ATH

- announcement from last week would likely be used as hype fuel

- closed $0.088, if it makes 10%, there's a chance that the momentum will push it above $0.10 and the pip change will take it up further

- the 500% gains mania in last week may have not ended and QPM looks to have similar recipe to those that was pumped to 500%

- I'll see how this open and decide whether to jump in</body>

   <body>VMT. 

Been doing well for 2 years now. Worth keeping a very close eye on. They are releasing 3 new bikes tonight in timing with Chinese NY. 

The company has had continuous solid growth and already has roughly 12,000 orders in line for the start of this year. 

Publicity/media campaign is probably needed to push them into the next bracket.

   <body>With an Alan Kohler interview expected this week at minimum I‚Äôd expect a small share price pump from boomers. ADN have a history of dropping a decent announcement before interviews or conferences too, so who knows...

    <body>I can probably answer my reasons for NWC. They were able to acquire an old copper cobalt land holding in Arizona. Limited exploration required due to existing resource estimates. High grade VMS is being hit on most holes with further abnormalities to be drilled within aeromagnetic surveys and DHEM. They have direction and a goal which is to flip into a producer with the existing infrastructure within around 18 months. to 2 years. They're probably missing a couple things i like in an exploration turned producer phase. Cornerstone holders are limited but perennial just came on board both accumulating on market above CR and in the CR. They need some fucking smart money on the BOD someone with experience in financial markets to really give a longer term prospective to some larger investors early but instead they have suffered at the hands of persher who just continue to dump on market within a certain range.</body>
