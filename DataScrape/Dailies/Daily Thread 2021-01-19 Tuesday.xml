   <body>SOR just keeps giving :)

Have no idea what's happening with ENV - up 72% and no news. I was looking at a buy over the weekend, didn't seem like much was happening then bam 50% - thought it was due to pull back and wow

Thank you LKE I've almost clawed back my original holding with a T2 today - sold "at the top" end of last year at 9c, with a plan to buy the dip. Had to buy at 12c today... Luckily worked out :)</body>

      <body>Still a couple of announcements to come, but yes, it does seem pretty ramped. 10% gains every day are unsustainable. Although $200m market cap means it's not crazily overpriced for its potential.</body>

    <body>Bullish as and have been for some years now. I'm planning to hold until they're well into production. Originally got in when I started messing with stonks in 2017. Was a retard and got royally fucked by the P&amp;D the old MD and an advertising group did (Easter Eggs anyone?). Their original plan was to sell the whole project and cut and run. The rest of the board didn't like that idea, so they made moves to go mining.  Averaged down, learnt a bit about DD and trading in the meantime.

Current state of play is they're pre-finance with a massive resource defined. 400 Mt @ 1.65% Li2O with a planned 20 year LOM. Transport is the biggest OPEX item, however the way China is going they're liable to build an express rail line to the front door if things go well.

They recently announced a 5+5, 30% offtake with Ganfeng the other week for 160,000 t/y of spodumene concentrate. The site has a shitload of tin (originally a tin mine) and there's an offtake imminent for that as well. Have a look at the drill results from a couple of years ago when they defined the JORC resource to get an idea of how big the ore body is.

Following more offtakes, there's financing to be completed then FID on the project expected by Q2 2021. Once FID is complete, they intend to smash construction and ship first product Q4 2022. They're looking for US$545mil CAPEX and have an expected ROI of \~2.5 years. From the sounds of the AGM preso (November) they had a bunch of equity partners in the wings, just no one had signed yet. Worth noting that the Manono project is 60% AVZ - with another 15% optioned to be purchased. The remaining 25% project is with the DRC government. Speaking of, they're in the process of finalising a special economic zone to give tax concessions in the interest of spurring on a pile of investment.

Biggest risks will be funding options resulting in a pile more dilution (2.8 billion SOI atm) or loans fucking the company over before it gets to production. There's plenty of boomers on HC carrying on about roaming warlords and ebola, but the DRC government is backing this project as they want it to succeed. Transport is touted as impossible by the same dickheads, but the BOD seem confident and the numbers make sense (road+rail to ports). They're negotiating better rates with the rail and port authorities for better rates and long term contracts.

On top of that, there's 100% AVZ owned tenements next door that potentially have an ore body as big as if not bigger than the current one they're working on. They did preliminary drilling, said it's a monster, and put that to bed to focus on Manono. It'll be interesting to see what they do with that in a couple of years.

So yeah, bullish as with a long term hold for me. The 2020 AGM presentation and the DFS are well worth reading through as it lays out in fairly simple English the state of play.</body>

Cro 2.4c 3 bags too early

Hzr 5.6c 1 bag too early

IMU 5.6c 1 bag too early


But then there's a bunch of others that were the right call to cut off, saving me money and a bunch that still have done nothing. So gotta know when to hold and when to fold.

With what I have now, I have faith, even tho IHL doing nothing and 9sp trending down, I know in under 6 months time I'll have major regret if I sell.</body>

       <body>It's crazy but it is a bull market. Timing is everything if shorting. Even when it falls, dip buyers will pile in at different levels.</body>

        <body>Bloody oath mate! Plenty of money on the sidelines looking at bank deposit data. It’s always one of those things when shorting trying to get it right without blowing up first. 

What can I say though, I’m getting plenty of practice with APT and TSLA!</body>

   <body>Afterpay is way down long term once large encumbents enter the BNPL space, the hype does down, and the cost of customer acquisition becomes transparent.
Though I think speculation and networks of people having made outsized gains can keep it high in the short term. It's hard to bet against momentum in the current market.
I blew through $10K shorting at $90 back in Aug. What's your sizing on these shorts as portfolio %?</body>

    <body>I reckon you are pretty dead on the money here mate.

I'm only using passive income for these so in a month the max I would be willing to lose on it is $16.6K.</body>

  <body>How is /u/atayls not bankrupt yet?

Last I checked months ago, the man was shorting Tesla, APT and the NASDAQ 100.

Most of my investment / trading circle are up 300%+ and then you have this guy shorting APT when Affirm is probably going to hit a new ATH tonight.</body>

   <body>Well the key is having more money than you lose. 

Now that is probably a little bit too complex for you to grasp, but that is how bankruptcy works.

   <body>That’s a good find. $153M market cap for $426M Base Case free cash flow is a good deal and you can be pretty sure of that gold inventory.

On the other hand, we have the opportunity cost of waiting 3-6 months for feasibility and final investment decision plus operational readiness.

I’m optimistic about gold but it’s worth knowing there’s already production mines with great cash flow and flat share prices, the market just isn’t responding to gold miners. Yet. Yet? Yet! I don’t know which of those.</body>

  <body>So excited for LRS's initial kaolin results today! Initial geophotography shows they're very much on track to match ADN's mine scale and quality.

Then there's the Gold and Lithium projects to come later in the year. Management better finally wake up from their COVID slumber and actually work on these world class tenements they have in their portfolio.

Still some of headwind with some bad oppies, but still a  🚀  🚀 🚀 today and probably for the rest of FY21.</body>

LRS: 4.5km x 4km east, west, north and south with a min intercept 15m-48m. Average thickness is more than double ADN, we have the size just will depend on how the grades turn up.

Next rocket ship for me looking like IXR - it’s lining up nicely and can see 3-4bags easily from this level</body>

   <comment ups="7" downs="0" author="Auspat884" created="2021-01-18 18:48:34+10:00">
    <body>- Large resource size (shaping up as the largest ionic clay rare earths project outside China) 
- simple/cheap processing compared to hard rock rare earths 
- perfect commodity to have exposure to right now given trade way tensions and supply/demand, and IXR basket is weighted more towards the higher-value heavy rare earths
- market cap is only just starting to wind up at $75mil and plenty of assays and economics scheduled to be released in next few weeks

Don’t get me wrong, I have plenty of other stocks in my portfolio which I expect to do well (otherwise I wouldn’t hold them anymore!) I just think IXR has the best chance of bagging quickly from this level</body>

  <body>Big gains gains today. **VUL** (+40%), **EMN** (+15%), **ESS** (+13%). [Did my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/kvph55/essential_metals_ess/) a few days ago on ESS and pleasantly surprised with a few green days. Wtf? Newsflow is coming... is anyone else on this?

**TMZ** (-12%), **PEN** (-3.3%) and **CXO** (-4.65%) weighed me down but still up \~12% which I'm happy with for a flat market. If I wasn't a coward I'd probably buy more TMZ. 

Took my original investment out of VUL and now free carrying after it virtually 4-bagged. This week will be red hot, but after that... surely a pullback. Surely? 

Thinking of keeping an eye out for a buying opportunity for Tyro payments **(TYR)** and [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/kzqwr5/tyro_payments_asxtyr_buying_opportunity/) about it. 

Waiting for the upcoming NextInvestor pick. They have historically done two a month and we've had nothing for Jan. Maybe a slow month with people on holidays and they're probably spending their VUL tendies on hookers and coke, so maybe we don't get anything for Jan... but the gap is closing.... 13 days left</body>

T2 on ENV. 
Cheeky 0.037 buy
Sell at 0.046 

Sweet. 

Why isn't anything happening to my CommSec account.

Silly CommSec it thinks I have double the stocks I bought hhahaa. Want an idiot. Man it would have been good to hold those, it went from my sale price of 48% up to 100% up. That would have been sweet gains.

Talk to the boys about how it looks like I could sell all this extra stock I don't own, make 14k. That would be sweet!!! 🚀🚀🚀

.... Wait.... Wait.... Executed orders.... I bought when i thought I sold. 

Oh shit fuck fuck, sweeeeet but fuck. I need to sell!!!!!!

Shat my dacks, order processing for 15-10 minutes to sell. Finally sold 0.048 - not quite the 0.060

GAINZ are GAINZ. 
Idiot be me.

  <body>Iron ore prices jumped in China  - A solid bounce off the 30 day MA. Unless Vale can ramp up production in the short term, demand will keep prices supported. I just can't see that happening. China will soon turn its attention to scrap sometime this year. India looking at curbing exports. The last month of China banging on about being over a barrel on pricing has only stalled the inevitable in my opinion. Most base metals to follow as the infrastructure spend globally will put pressure on supplies. Copper, Li, Ni, Iron ore, Manganese,  Aluminium (aloominum to the yanks). Even the auto spell doesn't recognize Aluminium. Current producers should do well, companies close to producing should do better, explorers that can hype any drilling result or deposit should moon.</body>

At the end of day it doesn’t matter unless something massive happens like a natural disaster the prices are still going to surge over the next few years. But I do think a stagnation short term will occur</body>

  <body>NVX signs Jeff Dahn. Former head of battery research at Tesla and Jeff's lab still has at year research deal with his team. 

DW8, still being held down with options just released their revenue for the quarter and it is insane. They are expanding by supplying to Amazon, Vivino and eBay to hit the direct to consumer market.

   <body>Bullish as and have been for some years now. I'm planning to hold until they're well into production. Originally got in when I started messing with stonks in 2017. Was a retard and got royally fucked by the P&amp;D the old MD and an advertising group did (Easter Eggs anyone?). Their original plan was to sell the whole project and cut and run. The rest of the board didn't like that idea, so they made moves to go mining.  Averaged down, learnt a bit about DD and trading in the meantime.

Current state of play is they're pre-finance with a massive resource defined. 400 Mt @ 1.65% Li2O with a planned 20 year LOM. Transport is the biggest OPEX item, however the way China is going they're liable to build an express rail line to the front door if things go well.

They recently announced a 5+5, 30% offtake with Ganfeng the other week for 160,000 t/y of spodumene concentrate. The site has a shitload of tin (originally a tin mine) and there's an offtake imminent for that as well. Have a look at the drill results from a couple of years ago when they defined the JORC resource to get an idea of how big the ore body is.

Following more offtakes, there's financing to be completed then FID on the project expected by Q2 2021. Once FID is complete, they intend to smash construction and ship first product Q4 2022. They're looking for US$545mil CAPEX and have an expected ROI of \~2.5 years. From the sounds of the AGM preso (November) they had a bunch of equity partners in the wings, just no one had signed yet. Worth noting that the Manono project is 60% AVZ - with another 15% optioned to be purchased. The remaining 25% project is with the DRC government. Speaking of, they're in the process of finalising a special economic zone to give tax concessions in the interest of spurring on a pile of investment.

Biggest risks will be funding options resulting in a pile more dilution (2.8 billion SOI atm) or loans fucking the company over before it gets to production. There's plenty of boomers on HC carrying on about roaming warlords and ebola, but the DRC government is backing this project as they want it to succeed. Transport is touted as impossible by the same dickheads, but the BOD seem confident and the numbers make sense (road+rail to ports). They're negotiating better rates with the rail and port authorities for better rates and long term contracts.

On top of that, there's 100% AVZ owned tenements next door that potentially have an ore body as big as if not bigger than the current one they're working on. They did preliminary drilling, said it's a monster, and put that to bed to focus on Manono. It'll be interesting to see what they do with that in a couple of years.

So yeah, bullish as with a long term hold for me. The 2020 AGM presentation and the DFS are well worth reading through as it lays out in fairly simple English the state of play.</body>

 [**https://www.the verge.com/2019/5/29/18531476/music-industry-song-royalties-metadata-credit-problems**](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18531476/music-industry-song-royalties-metadata-credit-problems) 

Jaxsta has built  the largest certified music credit database (certified as direct from music coys as opposed to crowd sourced)

Significant moats exist due to having to secure the supply of data from the music companies, then absorbing it into a deep-linked database that's usable. (Jaxsta are absorbing 100k records per day, 7 days a week)

Revenue will be generated from selling rights to use this database (APIs - we hope to hear of some soon), User subscriptions to Jaxsta Pro (recommencing this year) and onsite e-commerce (commencing this year).

Currently valued sub $20mil MC, low SOI and tightly held. Cash OH based on recent burn rate implies ok to end of 2021.  

Recent price action implies entry around 8c is reasonable with limited downside / unlimited upside.  Quarterly update due this month. Half Year results in February.  I'm a long-term holder.</body>

   <body>Isn't the product free? How do they make money? Serious question. I looked at it last night - constant issue of shares, quarterlies read like a sales pitch. What makes JXT special?</body>

  <body>Down to only 100 VUL units now, had to take more profits above $10 and look to re-enter in the $6-8 range. 

Sold up all my FYI  for a cheeky 20% gain. Sold up all my LTR for a flaccid 5% loss. 

All proceeds have been redirected to 5000 units of EGR and increasing my BRN &amp; SOR holdings.</body>

  <body>Sold the other half of my FEX shares. EMN and NC6 gains covered the losses plus $150. Sad to see such gains wasted offsetting a total fuck up. It's not so much that FEX is no good, rather, I bought at too high a price which put me behind from the get go. Hope it moons for all holders.</body>

   <body>We would like to know your'e thoughts?

As for my thoughts.

If your'e looking for a short term play then no.

Long term yes. I think the company will grow and the share price to follow.

45% per year for 5 years the share price may grow in my opinion.

I am not an expert. DYOR.</body>

  <body>SOR just keeps giving :)

Have no idea what's happening with ENV - up 72% and no news. I was looking at a buy over the weekend, didn't seem like much was happening then bam 50% - thought it was due to pull back and wow

Thank you LKE I've almost clawed back my original holding with a T2 today - sold "at the top" end of last year at 9c, with a plan to buy the dip. Had to buy at 12c today... Luckily worked out :)</body>

    <body>I'm at 4x coward gains. Doing as we all do and kicking myself for not putting in more. But I've started day trading it for extra CGT free gains (I feel it's not fully CGT free, but we tell ourselves lies)

     <body>Still a couple of announcements to come, but yes, it does seem pretty ramped. 10% gains every day are unsustainable. Although $200m market cap means it's not crazily overpriced for its potential.</body>
