    <body>Its not a pnd. If you look at what they're doing and who they're hooked up with, its legit.

What I don't like is all the options the EGM is setup to approve retrospectively. They're near or over a bn shares as is.</body>

   <body>Bit of misinformation regarding xst/sgc

- Hasnt started drilling yet. Should be this week.

- the independent resource assessment doesnt necessarily require drill data. It can be based off 2d and 3d seismic data etc and therefore could potentially be any day now. At the same time they could wait til post drill to refine it.

- it wont be a 30 day wait after the spud before more announcements. Data and results roll in as the drill proceeds. The managing directors have in the past updated shareholders as they went.

Edit: and for fucks sake its drilling for gas. Not oil.</body>

   <body>Going into Monday with 

LKE: 25C (Averaged up from 20c) very happy with this and look forward to more news! 


AV1: 20C  not expecting much positive growth until  further contracts are secured. But maybe some more hype could be nice.


RAC: $ 2.90. think I potentially got in too late here, could be big, or dead. Who knows. 


XST: 0.017C. Yeah this is a total gamble. God save me..


I think I might be fucked hahahahah</body>

This means the results were probably much higher than expected and they needed to verify and write a proper report with an independent verifier. Hold me guys before I jizz my pants.

  <body>Big week for **BPH**. Here are some links for those holding/interested:

[Keith Pitt - ABC Breakfast interview regarding Pep 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiGOVhUT4Jc&amp;t=2s) Keith Pitt is the Minister ultimately making the decision on Nopta approval. This short interview clearly shows a positive sentiment towards the project.

[David Breeze BPH Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqsU0oZqLDE&amp;t=1s) Good resource to get a snapshot on BPH and particuarly the significant resource at Pep 11. (Also can be used to help fall asleep as Breeze isn't the most  charismatic presenter)

  <body>Gotta hand it to BD1. As the shine was starting to come off the ovarian cancer detection announcement and people were starting to ask questions (why does nobody in the scientific community seem to care 3 days later about this "game changing breakthrough"? why was the original research paper this was based on in 2018 widely overlooked and only had 2 citations? where is more data about the latest trial?) and wonder if the market overreacted, they come out with another blockbuster sounding announcement sending the stock price soaring again.

I still think when the dust settles this will not be a multi-billion dollar company as most HC pumpers are betting their mortgages on. But i've been wrong before so we shall see. 

One thing is for sure, they've definitely proven they are good at creating hype, so i would not count anything out in the short term.

  <body>Big welcome to all the new members of the RAC city gang in the last couple of weeks.

Reminder that after big price surges like the one we saw recently, there's usually a pullback. Don't panic and sell, it's normal and expected. Just keep holding for that sweet CGT discount.

In case you need some crayons:

[Strong price surges tend to pull back to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level.](https://i.imgur.com/xOmfxy8.png) Should this happen again, we'll settle at around $2.44 **THIS IS THE DIP THAT YOU BUY IF YOU WANT MORE**

Why did I use a log-scale for the chart? Because [that's the most exciting one.](https://i.imgur.com/zvSqGOp.jpg) For a continuous 19 months now, RAC has remained in an overall uptrend within this rising channel on the log chart. That's *exponential* growth. This is the market re-rating RAC to a higher value. 

But as you all hopefully know, nothing goes up in a straight line. Every stock has some short term traders, day traders, bots doing high-frequency algo trades and whatever. You don't get a straight line up but you do get upwards movement within a channel, with some pull backs along the way.

Share price almost doubled in a week, there most likely will be a pull back. But unless fundamentals change, the price will continue up long term. Don't jump in and out, just hold and buy more so the tax man doesn't steal your gains.</body>

  <body>If your not in some sort sector that is going to hugely benefit from the Surge of EV's then what are you doing.

"In fact, in Europe, in the first nine months of 2020, EV sales outstripped those in China for the first time in at least five years. In the UK, in September 2020, EV sales eclipsed diesel sales for the first time, though only just. And, in the 11 months to November 2020, a landmark one million vehicle sales were either pure electric or hybrid models – accounting for 1 in every 10 passenger cars sold in Europe.</body>

  <body>Going into Monday with 

LKE: 25C (Averaged up from 20c) very happy with this and look forward to more news! 


AV1: 20C  not expecting much positive growth until  further contracts are secured. But maybe some more hype could be nice.


RAC: $ 2.90. think I potentially got in too late here, could be big, or dead. Who knows. 


XST: 0.017C. Yeah this is a total gamble. God save me..

  <body>How can this happen everytime and I still didn’t learn my lesson. FOMO in IOU @.82 and boom it’s down 10c. FUCK ME

One thing doe, I did learn the lesson of not to panic sell in the same hour of buying in thanks to VUL.</body>

  <body>To add a contrarian view for LRS from someone holding LRSOC since 0.008. Any one buying in now should beware of a "buy the hype, sell the news" dump if the upcoming announcement isn't spectacular. 

If you intend to hold longer term, I would worry less as I have confidence this stock has much more in it but in the short term, there is that risk to be aware of.</body>

  <body>My PFT journey:

1st purchase. Wow this company looks like it has great potential, I will invest some of my hard earned cash

2nd. Wow a dip, great buying opportunity at a discount

3rd. If I average down further my arsehole will hurt slightly less

4th. Please stop, it can only get so loose</body>
