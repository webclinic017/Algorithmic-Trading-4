   <body>Happy to get smashed for this comment, but I feel like the most-posted thing on this sub is "man if I'd just held that stock a year I'd have $32473920 by now." Correct me if I'm wrong, but it really looks like long term holding is a much better over trading strategy than STT. I mean sure, maybe you'll make a few sweet tendies short term, but odds are if you've found a solid company, long term is the go.</body>

    <body>Yes this has always been the case. Long term hold on solid companies present lower risk, but also a lower reward.

However if you wanna be an autistic fuck, and try and get some tendies then this is the place for you. 

I have my long term holds, but I also have my gambling money and since I work in a casino I can't gamble there so I do it here boi</body>

   <body>[SHH DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/kv12x0/shh_shree_minerals_huge_upside_potential_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for those who don’t venture out of the daily thread.

SHH (Shree Minerals) - huge upside potential with very low downside risk - Part II

Second crack at a DD post after my previous [VMS DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/jisvjw/vms_venture_minerals_huge_upside_potential_with/) mooned (well kinda - although 100% in less than 2 months is aok with me).  Don't mind this as risk/reward play. Reason i'm bullish below.

**Current state of play**

* Low MC of $18M (currently 2.3c) with 800M SOI 
* $1.8M in the bank and have stated that will be sufficient for 2021 (so CR anytime soon very unlikely)
* Main plays are iron ore, gold, zinc, copper
* Currently awaiting EPA permits for their iron ore mines, expected Q1 which should see us double
* Their iron ore mine has previously produced 5 shipments from about 5 years ago and were of acceptable grade but they shut the operation down due to the iron ore price, which is now about twice the price and expected to hold.
* Exploration License recently received and priority gold targets have very good surrounding grades (1535g/t, 135g/t, 26g/t, 14,5g/t)

**Why I'm bullish**

Ex DEG (1.3B MC) director Davide Bosio is a non executive director at SHH. He's a director at a corporate firm that specialises in CR/mergers/acquisitions and only gets paid $30k a year by SHH but recently bought $350k worth of shares  and is now their 2nd largest holder. Soon after that purchase, SHH stated they'll be actively starting the iron ore process.

As we have seen time and time again, when a director buys up and buys up big, good things are coming. Now it's just a waiting game but don't think 4-5 bags is out of the question.


Up 9.5% today so not sure if something is brewing. [Barchart](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/SHH.AX/overview) has it as a 100% strong buy with all indicators pointing to buy. Support at 2.1c and 1.8c but from observing today's action, there wasn't a great deal of selling so think we're getting in at a good time before its next leg up.

Good luck if you get on board and gamble responsibly.

Full disclosure: I hold 1M+ shares, purchased over the last couple of days.</body>

   <body>ANP - announcement of ceasing to be substantial shareholder highlighted who the culprit was in ruining the fun. Why do I T2? Why?? Fucking idiot that's why. 


IHL - you'll save my portfolio tomorrow won't you? All signs point to yes.


AV1 - and you'll take us to the moon in a few weeks. 


9SP - and you'll buy me a car in 12 months.


BRN - bought my parents $600 worth at 68c during the hype. Set up a selfwealth acc for them. Never told them it plummeted shortly after but I was able to sell today for 63c. Now they have $540 worth of AV1. I'm good at stonks.</body>

    <body>Bro why did you buy high and sell low do some more research before you buy in a stock. Also you do know that from charting I am expecting the share price to hit 72 cents. Today I expected it to close of at 0.615 but it closed at 0.625. I don’t have a crystal ball but if my charting is correct we may have 70 cents tomorrow or we may see some more accumulation tomorrow and then Wednesday we hit 70 cents. Just do your own research I have fucked up many times but learnt from my mistakes :(</body>

     <body>I agree. Have you looked at 2 year weekly chart?  Looks likely to push back up to today's highs over this week. Good vol so far today sets up for higher vol week on week.  The price could retest 58.5c intra weekly so some holders could get nervous on the downside but by friday, it is likely to close higher than last friday's close.</body>

     <body>Ok guys just wanted to give an honest update. What we saw today was an incorrect prediction. I thought we would see trading happening around 60 - 65 cents however we all saw what happened. We are still in an uptrend and however we will be trading around the 60 cents unless we hear an announcement or something incredible from the podcast tomorrow from the ceo. We have an overhead resistance at 62.5 cents.</body>

      <body>Dude. Just stop. You talk about your charting as if it were a sure thing. Even in your above answer, with hindsight, you're wrong again. 


Selling brn at 63c (now 57.5c) and buying av1 at 20.5c (now 21.5c) would have been the right play even if prices weren't where they are right now because I have certain criteria for my parents portfolio. Also, AV1 is a rocket.


So next time you shove unsolicited TA down someone's throat, just remember you sound like a jackass.

     <body>I already put in a buy order for high 3s, will add more at low 3s if it drops further. I think it's a good long term hold but I'm giving trading a bit of a go while the company sorts itself out. A leap forward in share price followed by a slow trickle back is exactly the way.</body>

  <body>ANP - announcement of ceasing to be substantial shareholder highlighted who the culprit was in ruining the fun. Why do I T2? Why?? Fucking idiot that's why. 


IHL - you'll save my portfolio tomorrow won't you? All signs point to yes.


AV1 - and you'll take us to the moon in a few weeks. 


9SP - and you'll buy me a car in 12 months.


BRN - bought my parents $600 worth at 68c during the hype. Set up a selfwealth acc for them. Never told them it plummeted shortly after but I was able to sell today for 63c. Now they have $540 worth of AV1. I'm good at stonks.</body>

   <body>Bro why did you buy high and sell low do some more research before you buy in a stock. Also you do know that from charting I am expecting the share price to hit 72 cents. Today I expected it to close of at 0.615 but it closed at 0.625. I don’t have a crystal ball but if my charting is correct we may have 70 cents tomorrow or we may see some more accumulation tomorrow and then Wednesday we hit 70 cents. Just do your own research I have fucked up many times but learnt from my mistakes :(</body>

I swapped BRN for AV1, because it's a safer play, for my parents portfolio. Bro.

    <body>I agree. Have you looked at 2 year weekly chart?  Looks likely to push back up to today's highs over this week. Good vol so far today sets up for higher vol week on week.  The price could retest 58.5c intra weekly so some holders could get nervous on the downside but by friday, it is likely to close higher than last friday's close.</body>

    <body>Ok guys just wanted to give an honest update. What we saw today was an incorrect prediction. I thought we would see trading happening around 60 - 65 cents however we all saw what happened. We are still in an uptrend and however we will be trading around the 60 cents unless we hear an announcement or something incredible from the podcast tomorrow from the ceo. We have an overhead resistance at 62.5 cents.</body>
    <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="ricklepicklemydickle" created="2021-01-13 14:09:45+10:00">
     <body>Dude. Just stop. You talk about your charting as if it were a sure thing. Even in your above answer, with hindsight, you're wrong again. 


Selling brn at 63c (now 57.5c) and buying av1 at 20.5c (now 21.5c) would have been the right play even if prices weren't where they are right now because I have certain criteria for my parents portfolio. Also, AV1 is a rocket.


So next time you shove unsolicited TA down someone's throat, just remember you sound like a jackass.


And you're shit at it.</body>

      <body>I said it was a prediction learn to read reddit Karren. Focus more on your portfolio rather than attacking people on online anonymous forums. I gave my input I never said I was going to be 100 percent correct. Secondly, I gave an update and did not run away from the problem.

Tough to have a negative portfolio when you've bought AV1 at 11.5c, IHL at 11.5c and ANP at 10c. Again, you need to get your maths sorted before you tell people BRN hitting 70c tmw 🤣🤣</body>

  <body>Happy to get smashed for this comment, but I feel like the most-posted thing on this sub is "man if I'd just held that stock a year I'd have $32473920 by now." Correct me if I'm wrong, but it really looks like long term holding is a much better over trading strategy than STT. I mean sure, maybe you'll make a few sweet tendies short term, but odds are if you've found a solid company, long term is the go.</body>
  <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="Snck_Pck" created="2021-01-12 16:15:01+10:00">
   <body>Yes this has always been the case. Long term hold on solid companies present lower risk, but also a lower reward.

However if you wanna be an autistic fuck, and try and get some tendies then this is the place for you. 

I have my long term holds, but I also have my gambling money and since I work in a casino I can't gamble there so I do it here boi</body>

But hey, anything could happen. I'll definitely hold PFT until December and keep accumulating units under $2. So I'm unlikely to get to 50,000 units, but it's my goal ☺️</body>

     <body>An okay announcement out this morning: PFT secures distribution for Woodbridge Smokehouse
products into 1,400 independent stores Nationally

I'm in it for the long haul, $20 seems widely ambitious but I think we'll do okay with anything around the $1 mark. Keep some cash aside, still a chance it might see 0.70ish before the next run.</body>
     <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="WingsAndRuin001" created="2021-01-12 09:16:58+10:00">
      <body>It's a pretty good announcement! Independent grocery stores are great, when I lived in Adelaide I used Foodland over Woolies or Coles. Their product range for quality foods at realistic prices was fantastic. Don't forget PFT is just stating that this extended partnership with Monde Nissin will increase revenue for PFT by a minimum of 15%, but there is still RedMart and the Singapore Meat Club figures unaccounted for, so should see well and truly more than 15% growth for PFT from WBSH alone ☺️ 

WBSH is only one business though too, so overall a minimum of 15% from WBSH from just this deal is pretty good 😍

$20 may be ambitious, but I don't think it's wildly unrealistic based on the company ambitions. I'll re-evaluate come December but at this stage, Cooper said he was aiming for 500 mil MC within 3-5 years. Should he pull that off, looking at approx a $20 SP assuming no share dilution.</body>
      <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="slothonreddit" created="2021-01-12 09:24:53+10:00">
       <body>Read it again, it says "based on this additional distribution and others, PFT revenue is expected to increase by a minimum of 15%". It does not mean this deal is worth an extra 15%, although I'll agree it's a well worded announcement if people think that.

Cooper et al can aim for whatever they want, let's see the results. We will all be extremely happy to see $20.</body>
       <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="WingsAndRuin001" created="2021-01-12 09:29:53+10:00">
        <body>Something doesn't add up then though, based on their quarter reports and how well they're doing from that, but then to only increase 15% revenue overall? Maybe they meant profit? Perhaps 15% is the minimum needed for an announcement on the ASX but they didn't want to over quote? Seems odd! Guess we'll find out when we see the next quarter report ☺️

Definitely agree, let's see the results. But doesn't hurt to be hopeful haha</body>
        <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="Zomg_ks" created="2021-01-12 11:20:46+10:00">
         <body>Yeah to me they have to be underselling it and just stating the minimum. All the numbers we've seen leading to this suggest much better growth.

My take away from this announcement was more that Woodbridge revenue had climbed back up so far as I'm fairly sure last FY its revenue had dipped slightly when they cut back on product lines to get it into turning a profit. Now that its profitable and they've ramped the revenue back up it its a gold star (or maybe one of those smell smiley stickers) to management from me as it speaks well to future partnerships or acquisitions</body>

  <body>I was up a touch over 6% when VUL hit $5.680 and ANP was still green. Ended the day a bees dick above 2% after a few drops as low as 1% up. 

I think i have averaged slightly more then 2% gain every day the market has been open this year. If i was 100% VUL i would have made about 10% a day and had enough money to buy a new fucking car. 

Anyway... I am now deep in AV1 after doing some background research. 

Deep in ANP even after todays dip.

SBW is... look. I am sorry if you got on SBW on my DD. I still hold, it is now my 2nd largest holding cause VUL just went super sayian. I am not selling SBW, i think it is a great company. 

EMN is shaping up to be a mini VUL now the hype is building again. Lets see new all time highs. 

PNV... well fuck golden child is now a blonde haired bastard. If it gets back to $3 ill top up but American needs to get its shit together before PNV really takes off again... or the hernia mesh gets announced or any of a dozen things PNV has got going for it... It will be undervalued soon.

WOA... its actually getting closer to my average now. Scary times.</body>

Second crack at a DD post after my previous [VMS DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/jisvjw/vms_venture_minerals_huge_upside_potential_with/) mooned (well kinda - although 100% in less than 2 months is aok with me).  Don't mind this as risk/reward play. Reason i'm bullish below.

**Current state of play**

* Low MC of $18M (currently 2.3c) with 800M SOI 
* $1.8M in the bank and have stated that will be sufficient for 2021 (so CR anytime soon very unlikely)
* Main plays are iron ore, gold, zinc, copper
* Currently awaiting EPA permits for their iron ore mines, expected Q1 which should see us double
* Their iron ore mine has previously produced 5 shipments from about 5 years ago and were of acceptable grade but they shut the operation down due to the iron ore price, which is now about twice the price and expected to hold.
* Exploration License recently received and priority gold targets have very good surrounding grades (1535g/t, 135g/t, 26g/t, 14,5g/t)

**Why I'm bullish**

Ex DEG (1.3B MC) director Davide Bosio is a non executive director at SHH. He's a director at a corporate firm that specialises in CR/mergers/acquisitions and only gets paid $30k a year by SHH but recently bought $350k worth of shares  and is now their 2nd largest holder. Soon after that purchase, SHH stated they'll be actively starting the iron ore process.

As we have seen time and time again, when a director buys up and buys up big, good things are coming. Now it's just a waiting game but don't think 4-5 bags is out of the question.


Up 9.5% today so not sure if something is brewing. [Barchart](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/SHH.AX/overview) has it as a 100% strong buy with all indicators pointing to buy. Support at 2.1c and 1.8c but from observing today's action, there wasn't a great deal of selling so think we're getting in at a good time before its next leg up.

Good luck if you get on board and gamble responsibly.

Full disclosure: I hold 1M+ shares, purchased over the last couple of days.</body>

    <body>Not necessarily. There's no evidence why there was a spike. 

And now say it genuinely was insider trading, you now gotta prove it. It's not a simple thing to just accuse people of doing. It's not exactly a cheap process hence why unless the reward is very large, it's not worth pursuing it from an economic standpoint.</body>

     <body>Battery day occured and there was plenty of hype that NVX was working with TSLA. When that didn't turn out to be the case, the stock was heavily sold. 

Since then there has been an explosive focus from G20 countries to commit to phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles prior to 2030 or 2035 and there are renewed commitments for many governments to utilise grid capable storage. That and the US election with Biden controlling both the house and the senate means that the green new deal is likely to happen and essentially this means that US based battery companies like NVX and TSLA are bound to receive funding to accelerate growth and implementation of both EV and battery tech.</body>

      <body>Gotcha - cheers for clarifying. TLSA hype is ridiculous (as we've seen with the whole Signal incident).

Should also be noted that Dems believe they'll only have a slight senate majority until mid terms in 2022 so they'll likely push through as much meaningful legislation as soon as they can. 

Imagine what it'd mean for ASX listed stocks if our embarrassment of a Government actually got on the EV train.</body>

       <body>With solar and wind being much cheaper than coal and solar in particular becoming cheaper and more efficient per kwh each year, the market will ultimately decide and has been deciding regardless of government direction. 

Even the state governments (irrespective of party) are moving towards renewable infrastructure with Snow Hydro, the former biggest battery in the world in SA and the soon to be biggest battery in the western hemisphere in NSW just being some notable examples. The sun power cable project to Asia is also another massive undertaking that is showing the promise of renewable production. 

TSLA is a whole other beast as they transition from being "just a car company" to generating revenue in battery cell production, commercial and residential storage, solar roof tiles, charging infrastructure for EV's and more.</body>

Given the current climate surrounding EVs and their future demand for Nickel / Cobalt, along with QPM's offtakes with LG and Samsung, I don't see any argument against buying right now while the price is still relatively cheap.</body>

  <body>QPM (formerly PM1)- manufacturing “clean” high quality nickel/cobalt material. Basically from what I can gather, they can turn fairly ordinary quality ore into higher quality material with the aim of supplying to LG chem and Samsung for EV/battery tech. 

Theyve got MOU’s signed with LG chem and samsung already so if either become binding any time soon will go well. Price action been solid last week and today. I own. DYOR.</body>

  <body>Legit question - are there any resources on the internet, to view historical Market Cap (preferably charts) for ASX stocks?

Eg, I am trying to view the current Market Cap value of a company, compared to what it was a year ago.

This is useful because share dilution, SPP, capital raising could make a share price look cheap, but market cap could be ATH.

I tried ycharts, but that doesnt have ASX stocks.</body>
  <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="Phishbaron" created="2021-01-12 10:23:52+10:00">
   <body>Why don’t you just look at the current market cap to see if it’s cheap</body>
   <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="gaginang101" created="2021-01-12 10:28:46+10:00">
    <body>But I need the market cap from a previous time period, to compare it to.

For eg, if the market cap of a company I am looking at, is double what it was a year ago, this would affect my decision making.</body>
    <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="timbuckley66" created="2021-01-12 10:53:39+10:00">
     <body>Due to issuing more shares or similar? Company reports may be the only way. Your average charts don't show pre share split/consolidation or new issuance on a MC basis before and after. Only price action. It would be a great chart to see tho. Can you put up a link if you find the chart/settings?</body>
     <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="gaginang101" created="2021-01-12 11:00:56+10:00">
      <body>Yes, due to issuing more shares.

Company reports would have that info, but will take a lot of tedious work, when a chart would be handy.

The only thing similar I have found so far, was on ycharts, by appending the URL "/market\_cap" at the end of the URL.

For example:

[https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market\_cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap)</body>

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=ASX%3AWEB](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=ASX%3AWEB)

Just go to the top, of the page, click on "Financials", and then type in "Market Capitalization".

In my use case, looking at webjet, the share price chart makes it seem it is about 40% precovid price, but if you look at market cap, it is almost 70% precovid.</body>

   <body>If you're looking for share dilution over time, check your broker. Most offer some sort of Morningstar-eque 'research' with useless valuations but good data. The one-pagers I get have historical Shares Outstanding year over year so you might have access to something similar.

Note this won't be fully-diluted share information so, employee options for example, require deeper reading into company reports, but it's good enough.

But...

For value investing or FA, historical market cap isn't any more useful than historical share price because we need to see those numbers in relationship or context to another number like revenue, profit, growth rates, assets/liabilities or free cash flow. This is why you'll find historical EPS or PE but not historical market cap.</body>

   <body>Just took a wander through the last 5 quarterlies and the annual report.

Here's my (slightly rearranged) summary. Sorry about the crappy formatting. [imgur](https://imgur.com/8tfvji8)

Anyway, what I don't like about it is that while receipts from customers are obviously growing so too are all of the scalable expenses. There might be a trend of the multiple of expense to receipts (because it is a *multiple*) reducing, but any trend is slow and the ratio actually went up last quarter.

If the trend continues (that is a big assumption) they would still be 4-5 quarters away from receipts meeting operating costs. So, they are still a fair ways off generating cash rather than burning it.

Note that production expense alone is larger than receipts as matters currently stand. I would much prefer to see receipts ahead of production expense, with surplus and other inflows going into R&amp;D, capex etc, but that is not the case here.

In conclusion I struggle to justify the present 95M market cap. The assets component of that is probably around 5M so the other 90M has to be future cash flows. Furthermore, funding is coming from issue of equity rather than debt, so those future cashflows may be expected to be spread thinner than implied by the present number of shares.

I can only assume somebody is valuing this through a market sizing and capture approach, and a high opinion of the capabilities of key management, but for me the prospect is still too far off free cash generation. I would say it may be generously priced.</body>

   <body>Let me know when you sell - that will be my buy signal for an entry. Looks like consolidation is nearing an end. If it reaches 44c that is a buy entry with a stop on a daily close below 44c. Might not reach it. Vol is picking up and any bounce should take it to 60c. I would hold unless 44c is broken on a close. At least that gives you a defined loss if the uptrend is broken and upside to 60c at least if this is just consolidation.</body>

All the big lithium boys in Aus are having a bad day, for example LTR, PLS, GXY. 

We’ve had 3-4 weeks of solid upward movement in these companies. A pull back was always on the cards. 

If you’re still bullish on lithium/EV’s/Battery tech and think CXO can be a profitable player in that space, why would you sell?

   <body>It went from 8c to 26c without a pullback - in 2 weeks! Now we wait and see  where the pullback stops, where the price consolidates and whether that sets up for a move higher. Possible realistic supports are 17c, 14.5c. No one knows whether these will be hit/tested/broken and we won't know until a few days (minimum) pass by and the pull back plays out.</body>

  <body>PNV shit the bed last quarter but Q1 looking great. SP has shit itself today like a PM at a Maccas.

If you missed out getting in for a gold coin now is the time.

This is a loooong hold but is easily an $18 company by 2025.</body>

   <body>Sell me more on this pee in vee stock.

I like the fact that it doesn't look like a pump and dump (those gains were hard fought). And that you think it can go from $2 to $18 in 5 years.

Is this the scaffolded skin graft stuff?</body>

    <body>Basically COVID has fucked their hospital sales - esp. in the USA, but their bandages are above and beyond anything else on the market and next level in terms of fast rehab of wounds.

The burn shit which they are recruiting trial patients for now looks amazing but that's going to be a 2 year pay out on the FDA clinical trials. Once done they will sell their shit to every hospital in the USA. They'll be slapping the fuckers on to celebrity kids rushing out of Californian bushfires faster than you can drive the yacht you buy with the profits.

When share price dropped to a $2 coin a few months back, the directer dumped his fucking mortgage into the pool to buy as much as he could which is always a good sign.

Q1 sales are up by about 75% so even if you want to make some coward gains it's only a 3 month wait.

I'm watching this slump and will be buying more if it drops again tomorrow, even if it fucks my average. That's how balls deep I am in this stock.</body>

     <body>Sounds interesting, thanks for the idea I will look into it a bit more. Interested more in long plays than coward gains.</body>

  <body>Anyone seen Chamath  Palihapitiya's latest tongue lashing of US CEO's? I love that guy. One of the few people in the financial industry that talks the truth rather than lie to your face. Not many rich people still have their integrity. 

I would say possible run again for BRN. Lithium stocks still getting support. Z1P $2  by Xmas? Copper stocks supported. Gotta find some companies getting close to producing copper or nickel.</body>

  <body>So I had 5200 units in a company, I went to sell today (at limit) set it for good for day, it didn’t go through and now it says I have 10,400 units in the company even though the order canceled itself after close. Is this normal?</body>

  <body>Here is a BRN chart for anyone interested. It shows the uptrend and the current consolidation underway. It is a weekly so anything can happen in this week and until friday's close or some obvious event happens to negate the trend, the trend is intact.

    <body>They did come in early enough to have had ample time to let the market act. Clearly took a very wrong turn about it. The last major announcement also had no positive impact on the price. If this is how others who have likely done more than 2 minutes of reading are acting, it's got me a little concerned about it rocketing, but I'll absolutely keep watch of it to make a quick buck here and there.</body>

     <body>A lot of the downward price action was on the back of a shitload of options being converted in bulk, smackbang at the timing of the announcement, dilluting the price, along with the announcement being below expectations set by management.
