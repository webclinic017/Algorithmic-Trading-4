  <comment ups="11" downs="0" author="itsdankreddit" created="2021-01-21 13:42:54+10:00">
   <body>If you bought $500 worth and it's 1% down then it's worth $495 minus your trading fee (let's assume you're smart and are using Selfwealth) of $9.50. Your actual value at this point is $485.50 but since it's AVA and you've got paper hands, you sell.

That triggers another $9.50 in trading fees and as such, you receive $476 back into your account. From your original $500 investment you have actually lost 4.8% of which only 1% is claimable as a capital loss. 

This is why you don't trade less than $5k per share, the economics simply don't make sense.</body>
   <comment ups="15" downs="0" author="DrizzyDradle" created="2021-01-21 13:58:54+10:00">
    <body>&gt;you have actually lost 4.8% **of which only 1% is claimable as a capital loss**. 

Capital Gains Amount is calculated as the Capital Proceeds minus the Cost Base.

Cost Base here would be $500 + $9.50 + $9.50.

Proceeds of sale would be $495.

So the claimable Capital Loss is $24. Which is 4.8% of $500.</body>

  <body>**If you're not in LKE, consider that**

1. NVX results for their lithium samples are coming out in Feb
2. They've just funded their Kachi project drilling
3. The price will increase as lithium becomes scarce
4. Offtakes will follow NVX testing results and they'll be producing in two years. Few Lithium plays are this advanced stage wise. 

**If you're not in NVX, consider that**

1. They've just signed on the battery godfather Jeff Dahn who is working with TSLA for another 5 years as well.
2. They'll be able to ramp production of Synthetic graphite faster now with the US gov funding for a plant with Philips. 
3. Samsung SDI deliveries have started. Sanyo/Panasonic about to move from MOU to contract. Panasonic currently helps make TSLA batteries inside the gigafactories.
4. Besides their battery testing, they also have the patents for the million mile battery and DPMG process.
5. They are based in the US in the soon to be heartland of EV production, Texas.</body>

    <body>Depends if the current developments allow them to ramp anode production at a faster rate and simply having Dahn onboard means that they've got instant street cred.

  <body>Bagged ANP yesterday and was contemplating free carrying today. Decided to double my holding instead. Fairly balls deep now for me.

  <body>Fuck 9pm already. 

Got a new flair today. 

SBW moved above 20c and I got excited. Then news came out a 7pm and I am less excited. It also closed below 20c so booooo.

I moved some of my VUL cash into ANP AV1 SBW and PNV. Still got a few thousand spare, maybe uranium play or something else. I like NC6 but today was not the day to buy in.

I didnt exactly call the VUL red day but I knew it was coming. Could be a bloodbath in the future, could consolidate. 

I feel a rising urge to buy MORE RLT. But I am holding off for now. I dont have a lot but it could do a few bags easily before the end of the year. Mind you i thought it would bag before December last year so i am not always right. 

BRN was a nice surprise. Almost made up for SBW going backwards from 22c.</body>

wondering if z1p will get into the 6’s and stay there

go my little rockets EMN PUR LKE LRSOC 

DW8 is just a ticking time bomb but in a good way. with continued good news I’m sure it can go to 10 cents this year. also Dean Taylor may as well be James Dean. 

Still holding RMX out of curiosity, only down -$150 so I’m not too bothered. Will be interested in what the SP does on the next anns or if they strike some gold 


APT may as well be baby tesla. fuck a p/e ratio when you’re a growth stock xxxx</body>

    <body>I’d describe this as a strategic deal - first to market with a ‘friendly’ Australian counterparty that has strong existing ties to...(drumroll) Spotify.  

To this end, it would be priced accordingly.

I can understand the market being focused on revenue, however as we saw in the quarterly, they have plenty of cash on hand and their focus is strategic rather than short term.  It’s a buy/hold for me.

  <body>AV1 - is there a term for when you put a buy order in at the end of the queue and then the line get a sold into and bounces back immediately? Got that 17c dip and it then it closed flat. Feelsgoodmang. Plus, someone looked at broker data for last week and noticed that Bell Potter soaked up over $100k worth of shares from who I'm guessing were paperhanded retail sellers.

Also, here's a little copy paste from hotcopper:  I think the market is waiting for the Jan 31st announcement. Last two years our quarterly results for December have been released on that day.

🚀🚀🚀🚀


ANP - take a breather. The next push is gonna be a big one. Takeover from Sarepta to take us over $1 any day now please. 


IHL - guess we wait another week.

Edit: All silicone Andodes are note going to happen in the next 10 years. At battery day, Tesla's proposal will still see a 70% graphite anode.

   <body>Biased investor here.
It has been a stagnant stock for a fair while, so a lot of people would have been waiting to sell, which they seem to be doing. Further to that, one of their majority shareholders, Lind Asset Management is constantly offloading shares, keeping the price down. This might stifle excitement around the price.

Long story short. Im not selling any time soon. Those incoming results smell like a fresh boner.</body>

    <body>Idk if Lind is behind this as well but there's been some ridiculous buy and sell order prices messing up market depth as well over the last few months. Millions of buy orders at 0.1c and a fair few sell orders up near 9-10c so the buy to sell ratio looks off</body>

   <body>Yep, jumped in on open @ .366. Should have waited a day. Still not sure if it’s a smart play but definitely a long hold, just hoping they get good results from the phase 1 (not till end of year) but they are funded through to phase 2 and were going to look at what Paul Hopper called basket trials where they will do a concurrent trial with other cancers</body>

  <body>SOR looks kinda safe now, I'm going to try an entry. The huge benefit of SOR is that it is exempt from CGT.

This means my losses will be offset by tax, but my gains will be effectively doubled as I'm in the 45% bracket.

  <body>**LKE** \- Would have expected it to edge up more, still green so not complaining. 

**PBH** \- Solid performance and announcement.  

**QPM** \- Solid run this week, looks like there a pullback. Might look to enter today.

**APC** \- Amazing announcement on their gold drilling results. Surprised no one has mentioned this. Have bought and hold lets see where this takes us. 🚀 🚀 🚀

  <body>EMN and VUL drawbacks today have me down ~1k. Bit shit but two $2k days back to back can’t last forever. 

TMZ didn’t go as hard as I’d hoped. Good results today but only a minor SP bump. FEX also had a positive ann the other day and not a lot happened. Priced in I guess.

Congrats to Z1P bag holders! Not among you but today I wish I was. 

Gonna keep holding VUL. Free carrying at this point and happy to check back in end of 2021.</body>

   <body>I like cyber sec &amp; military but yeah obviously this looks like penny stock trash. Could you spoonfeed a bit of info if you have any? I see it was a $7 share a few years ago, but been solidly below 10c for the past year with effectively zero movement since August and an $8M market cap. Hotcopper seem excited, as usual, so very little information there.

Seems like Cipherpoint mostly sell a product (or product-as-a-service) while Brace168 were exclusively an MSSP - anyone have any insights as to the typical fundamental outcome of an acquisition of an MSSP by a product developer? Common + shrewd move, or arbitrary pocket change acquisition indicating flailing around to create change of any kind?</body>
