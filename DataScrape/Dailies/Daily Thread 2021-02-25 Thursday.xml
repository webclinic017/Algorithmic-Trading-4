   <body>I’m at around 30% of my portfolio in GRR and I’m thinking about going in more? It has to be the safest around with bagger potential. Talk me out of it?

Edit What are the negatives? How can this go wrong? Anyone done research on it and decided they didn’t like it? If so what did you put money in?</body>

    <body>I’ve been keeping a close eye on this one. 

Personally I’m waiting for a dip in the iron ore price and subsequent share price drop before entering the fray. Maybe a bit different for you as you’d only average up. 

GRR is Chinese owned and managed, I know there have been some doubts about its moves, i.e failed property investments (one would think they’d re-invest into expanding the mine, acquisitions etc). Apart from this , there will always concern whether the Chinese govt will introduce measures to curb the current iron price, but they seem captive to Aussie iron. 

Personally I wouldn’t want my portfolio being 30% plus reliant on a single commodity especially when it’s at a high. But if you have strong autist faith in it - go for it!  

Good job getting into it early if you did! 🚀</body>

   <body>RLT: 
- Approximately 4-6 weeks away from the Helium drill results. 
- They’ve just started production of their cryovac machines to transport the COVID vaccine. Have had global interest and have started producing for a distributor (not yet announced). Rumours of it being Johnson and Johnson who have a MC of 4-500bil.

     <body>G'day mate. Yeah I have been bearish since mid 2019.

If you want to look at defensive longs I suppose consumer non-discretionary [Consumer Staples ie WOW, COL], and some consumer discretionary (Casino's and Gaming] as well as Healthcare.

They should hold up better than most but will almost certainly still sell off in a significant broad market correction.

You can consider index puts, or inverse ETFs [BEAR. BBUS. BBOZ, SNAS] also. But this are very risky instruments that should only form part of your portfolio if you have specific risk mitigation protocols as part of your investment strategy.

Gold, silver have traditionally been a flight to safety asset, but they also sold off during the GFC before they rallied afterwards.

The best thing to do is to map out an overarching plan and consider all the possible elements you could utilise.</body>

  <body>This article gives a great breakdown of the lifecycle of of investing in a mineral resource/ mining startup, where you can expect the inflection points and it might help with timing of entry and exits

Great reading for anyone taking a punt in the mining sector

     <body>You are 100% correct and that is a real thing, so I looked at SGC's history and it has the cycle in that article over and over again. So I got faith. But yeah 100% be on the look out for a "hole in the ground with a liar standing next to it." For example XST does NOT have this history... the only thing that gives them any credibility is their attachment to SGC. Well... in my smooth brained reasoning anyway.</body>

    <body>The trick is finding the sweet spot. I've been thinking on this the last few days and the main ones that will crawl back are generally larger companies that took a hit, and their not exactly meme worthy when it's a massive company or considered a boomer stock. Should've threw some money at them 6 months ago to benefit best now. Feel like I should pick new stocks being listed / ipo using the sure-fire dart board technique.</body>

  <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="bhavdabeast" created="2021-02-24 19:50:46+10:00">
   <body>Lmao i literally asked the same question about a month ago. So I'm guessing you haven't actually checked and just want someone to give u the brains. Later last year, the NVM deal started and they go for 6 months. First results expected in 4 months from then, which would be Feb 2021. Last month, the CEO said it may be later Feb - early March.

Now that's all the legit details (don't quote me on this) I can remember. If you go on ASX and like youtube you should find the same info. My stance currently is that they would be announcing it soon, on a Friday/Monday? If you ask me it's definitely before March 9 because that's when the GM is and they want people to be happy enough to vote to allow the new shares for the company. 

But then again, I could just be making all of this up so do your own research. Here are a few useful links (hopefully)

- Approximately 4-6 weeks away from the Helium drill results. 
- They’ve just started production of their cryovac machines to transport the COVID vaccine. Have had global interest and have started producing for a distributor (not yet announced). Rumours of it being Johnson and Johnson who have a MC of 4-500bil. 

Plenty of short term reasons for rockets 🚀. Currently at a decent entry price, anything under $2 in my opinion.</body>

  <body>Can one of the many people smarter than me here help me understand why a company restructure and funding, plus the appointment of the NST head honcho would send VXR up 233%.

I generally try to understand how the market will respond to a certain type of an announcement but I’m struggling to connect the dots on this one.

Help a fellow retard understand, please.

  <body>After being down 6.5k yesterday, I clawed a good part of it back today thanks to LRS. Got out at 96 and managed to scrape a few pips throughout the day as well which was nice.

QPM - traded like a beast all day but ended flat 🤷‍♂️

PRL - I knew what was coming but have decided to suffer through it. Will buy more if it drops low enough.

JXT - have cycled out of tech but not letting go off this puppy. Looks strong and ready to go.

  <body>Does it really matter when I convert my LRS options?

Been holding for 9 months now, got in at a 1.8c avg price.

Is there any difference in converting now and holding for 12 month vs converting in 12 months time?

Holding either way</body>
  <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="Cornerstone_trader" created="2021-02-24 18:02:16+10:00">
   <body>Yeah the minute you convert them the CGT clock gets reset so if your already 9 months in and you want to avoid CGT then either wait another 3 months and then sell the oppies on market to take your profit without converting , or if you want to hold for the long term then either convert now to start that 12 month clock ticking or just hold them until 12 months and sell them on market.

Don’t let tax be the reason for missing out on taking a good profit though either. It’s much better to take a profit and pay a little tax than keep holding purely for tax reasons and missing the peak and holding a stock all the way back to break even or a loss. Not saying that’ll happen but tax should not be the deciding factor on when to sell a stock, you can more than make up for the tax you’ll pay by trading a parcel to increase your holdings whilst maintaining a core long term investment</body>

   <body>Only posted their clay mining drill results to begin with, yet to see advances on gold projects and their JV lithium project..

However they’re still only a $100m MC so there’s a long way to go over the next few years. Once there’s updates on the other projects it could easlily turn into a 3-400m MC business pretty quickly imo.

LKE are a 400m MC and they are still a while off producing as well.</body>

   <body>I tend to avoid industrial minerals in general for the simple fact they don”t really have longevity compared to base metals. So projects involving kaolin, hallyosite, manganese, rare earths typically the longer term you are on them the more money you lose. 

As for LRS the expectation I’ve seen both on forums and here concerns me. There appears to be a lot misinterpreted information about what is occurring. People are talking about LRS producing a mine in a short timeframe which is bullshit. They are also comparing advanced projects such as ADN to LRS drilling results. I don’t believe there’s room for two players in this mineral and I believe ADN will possibly have a monopoly. You really can’t compare the two market caps. I mentioned this morning why no one is comparing lrs market cap to MEP. MEP would be considered cheap compared to LRS and is in a more advanced development stage.

Hallyosite is a tough one to work out. there really is limited uses for the product and none are currently economical. Kaolin has supply demand shifts which cause mass fluctuations in price at any given time and depending on agreement. There is no spot price for these minerals. The R&amp;D is almost decades away for both finding a way to make hallyosite extractable from kaolinite and finding wide spread use for the product. Until they find away to make it soluble its limited in what can be done with it.

However don’t let anyone influence your decisions on it. this stock has come a long way plus id be monitoring it dual listing at the same time to figure out how to play the hype.</body>

   <body>I’ve been keeping a close eye on this one. 

Personally I’m waiting for a dip in the iron ore price and subsequent share price drop before entering the fray. Maybe a bit different for you as you’d only average up. 

GRR is Chinese owned and managed, I know there have been some doubts about its moves, i.e failed property investments (one would think they’d re-invest into expanding the mine, acquisitions etc). Apart from this , there will always concern whether the Chinese govt will introduce measures to curb the current iron price, but they seem captive to Aussie iron. 

Personally I wouldn’t want my portfolio being 30% plus reliant on a single commodity especially when it’s at a high. But if you have strong autist faith in it - go for it!  

Good job getting into it early if you did! 🚀</body>

Haven’t got any STN, but there’s a load of unloved gold explorers in the 30-50m mark that are doing nothing SP wise.

  <body>RFT is kinda doing nothing... It almost got me the 20% on day 1 (0.001 off FML) but is back to square one. What's not an over hyped stock that I can look into for the journey?</body>

  <body>Why are HUM shares falling badly today when it is the only BNPL share on the ASX that makes a decent profit. According to Street Talk in the AFR, APT shares are trading at 41 times forward revenue, Z1p playing catch up at 14.7 times whilst HUM shares is at 1.4 times revenue. Am I missing something here or have the short sellers taken over HUM?</body>

  <body>How do you get in on a cap raise? I want to buy shares in one company I don't own and options in another that are being offered as part of a cap raise. Is there any way to buy shares at their listed price in the CR or do I have to wait for them to come on the market?</body>
