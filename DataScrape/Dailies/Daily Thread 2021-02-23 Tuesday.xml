     <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="luner124" created="2021-02-22 18:53:44+10:00">
      <body>Nah I disagree. I think people (myself included) really believe in LKE. any mention of selling is going to get you downvoted but the fact is, a stock can't climb like it did today and not correct! 

I'm not selling LKE but I am fully aware the price will drop a little from here before rebounding again upwards.

If you want to try and time the market, good luck! But try not to get burnt.</body>

   <body>My pick for today's overnight hold is COD, a copper miner that commenced trading on ASX in late October 2020. 

IPO price 30c, opening day high 51c and closed at 44c. ATH is still 51c.

**Reasons:**

* Low float: 85mil SOI [disclosed](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-top-20-securityholders.5741276/), I believe that was fully diluted count, as IRESS showing 69mil float. About 10mil of which are under [escrow](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-asx-notice-admission-to-official-list.5710115/). Top 20 holding 48mil as disclosed on 06/11/2020, so leaving the market between 21mil and 37mil shares to trade.
* Huge volume: usual daily volume eyeball at around 100k, IPO day had 1.73mil vol, and today it had 3.7mil vol. Not a huge volume compared to many other hot stocks (looking at you, IOU), but this abnormal spike in trading volume in a single stock usually signals something.
* Mad intra-day gains: like we've seen last week, stocks with decent intraday gains that made it to top gainers list and put them on traders' radar usually have good run on subsequent days, COD made 53% by closing today, 5th on the list.
* Near ATH: after the mad gains today and a strong gap up close from 43.5c at 4pm and closed at 46c, it is now just 5c, or 10 pips away from challenging its 51c ATH.
* "Fundamentals": copper spot price at [52-wk high](https://www.marketindex.com.au/copper) ( u/SpecAnalist may have more valuable input on this topic as he [sounds like he knows this space](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lp8spe/market_open_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gobb4sb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), this may fuel some hype combined with COD's today's [announcement](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-assays-confirm-huge-extent-of-emmie-bluff-cu-mineralisation.5918441/#post-51221418) (idk how to read miners' fundamentals so it could be shit, whoever knows how to read it, tell me if I'm fucked). COD holding [$11.78mil cash](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-december-2020-quarterly-activities-and-cashflow-reports.5878655/) as at 31/12/2020, assuming they haven't burned them all in two months, that's about 1/3 of their current MC of $32mil as at today's closing price.
* Risk/Reward: didn't look at this because I had too much coffee, will sell at market price if I got fucked too hard.</body>

    <body>Copper spot price touched 10 year highs today!
A copper supply crunch is here NOW, and its occurring simultaneously with Biden's Green/Renewables mandate and EV revolution.  
EV's use a lot more copper than lithium, cobalt/ anything else and thats not including infrastructure pre car - https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/glencore-ev-needs-1024x313.jpg 

Only a couple of major new Copper discoveries have been made in the last 4yrs and the only major new project coming online in Aus in the next 5yrs is currently RIO's Winu project.

Gold, Lithium, Graphite and Nickel have all there runs through 2020 and I believe Copper will dominate 2021 which is fortunate as all the juniors MCs are still relatively cheap.

COD is definitely in big boy country, Olympic Dam is a beast!
The strike extension is definitely exciting I would just preface that each of those DD holes costs close to $500k and it will be costly to mine down to 400m deep. So hopefully they can find a shitload of Copper down there with the 1,000m deep drill hole in Q2 so Olympic Dam owners BHP can come take them out :)</body>

        <body>COD looks good based on seller numbers and volume. That will change in the morning obviously, but it shows there should be demand.

AXE looks decent too. MXO potentially as well, but no announcement today so it's not clear why it moved so much.</body>

   <body>My grandad would tell me a story as a child about a bull and his calf that were running through a paddock one day and stumble across a herd of sheep. The young calf excitedly grabs the bull and says ‚ÄúDad let‚Äôs run down and fuck one of these sheep‚Äù the bull calmly says to the calf ‚Äúson, let‚Äôs walk down there and fuck em all‚Äù  - point of the story is my grand dad was right - I‚Äôm thinking about cashing out of some profits and prepare for a potential correction  .</body>

Have a watch of this video bro this guy sums it up perfectly - let me know after your thoughts but to play devils advocate I‚Äôd argue as long as the US keeps printing money and can pay back International debt in US currency the circus will continue - personally I think we will see a monster correction in the next 6 months</body>

        <body>Definitely food for thought, I do agree with the interest rate point, my guess tho is how long will we see rates at this level for? I‚Äôve never understood personally the stretching of oneself financially and not leaving a buffer for the inevitable rate rise. 
That‚Äôs enough sensible talk, back to autist mode. We‚Äôre due a market collapse I need my gambling fix ergo gold is good in times of strife all in on NVA üöÄüöÄüöÄ</body>

New positions:

CHK - wanted to ride the copper hype. Playing around assay results which are due anytime now. Could be good could be shit. But momentum is there so don‚Äôt care. Talk of takeover and shit.

Dw8 - someone did DD. Might double down.

          <body>First trade actually, my $70,000 is now $129000 so not doing so bad. I just read articles on ADN and halloysite because of LRS. So I was just basing my opinion on this 

https://themarketherald.com.au/andromeda-metals-asxadn-begins-drilling-at-condooringie-halloysite-kaolin-prospect-2020-05-18/

I don't see how they're 4-5 years ahead of LRS if they announced their results end of last year?

Also assumed you were a guy because we generally say dumber things than women</body>
          <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="rhythm34" created="2021-02-22 21:20:11+10:00">
           <body>ADN have seven separate halloysite-kaolin tenements in SA. You have linked to initial drilling of Condooringie (since renamed Hammerhead) which is a downstream project and likely won‚Äôt be operational until 2025+. So 5 years from drilling to operation, and that‚Äôs very optimistic. So by your own timeline even ADN‚Äôs backup projects are ahead of LRS. 

The ADN/MEP Great White project which is starting in less than a year (formerly called Carey‚Äôs Well) began development with MEP in 2012. So it will be 10 years almost to the day from first drilling to operating mine &amp; revenue. 

Question for you: How long to you realistically think it will take LRS to go from initial drill results -&gt; more drilling -&gt; inferred/measured/indicated resource -&gt; scoping study -&gt; preliminary feasibility study -&gt; definitive feasibility study -&gt; mining lease application, environmental controls -&gt; financing -&gt; construction &amp; processing plant -&gt; mining -&gt; sales &amp; revenue. Bearing in mind you can‚Äôt really skip any of those steps, all come with risk of failure, and all cost money. Really recommend reading that seekingalpha link in full if you want to get the most from your spec investing, there‚Äôs a lot of really important info. 

I can tell you right now with a high degree of confidence that LRS will not be mining halloysite before 2025 (if at all)</body>

  <body>Last time I posted my own personal rules I got bombarded by a bunch of idiot cunts telling me why they disagree with the way I trade and inundated with messages from even bigger idiot cunts thanking me. Really fucking annoying but given I haven‚Äôt seen a reduction in the autism on this sub and in fact, have seen even more idiocy I feel compelled to post chapter 2: what do i invest in?
With more companies listed on the asx than dollars you have in the bank and more individual tickers listed in this sub than sexual partners we‚Äôve collectively had, it can be hard to know what to invest in. For this reason, I only invest in what I believe in. Now 20 years ago you would‚Äôve thought by 2021 we would have flying cars and robots doing all our work and not the covid fuckscape that we currently find ourselves in. But I digress, how is this relevant?
Well you fucking retard think about what the future holds. Do you think flying cars and autonomous robots are the future? For me personally maybe not the cars anytime soon given we had 3 planes crash land in the last 48 hours but definitely autonomous robots. For this reason, I think investing in companies targeting autonomous robots would be a good investment. 
Now I truly believe a correction and possibly even a bigger crash is imminent. The entire market makes less sense than my stock purchases and for this reason, I‚Äôm currently only holding 3 stocks and have moved the majority of my portfolio to cash. BUT, the stocks I do hold are things I believe in, for example VR1. I truly believe VR and AR to be the next tech revolution. Hence the investment. Now I‚Äôm not gonna tell you what to do with your money, any short term
pumps are harmful to the long term prospects of a stock and therefore it is not in my interests as a long term investor for you all to jump on. This is merely an example of how and why I chose a stock. 
‚ÄúBut Ad4nothing, how does this help me?‚Äù I hear you say. Well retard, there‚Äôs every likelihood you have some understanding of an industry that allows you to see the future of said industry. Hot tip: you can use this knowledge to choose a company to invest in! Fucking crazy I know. Now look, this might be a bit advanced for you autists who are fuelled by rocket emojis, but trust me. Stick to what you know, look into the future and picture where you see the world going. There in-lies your next stock.

For this I would argue the biggest change coming in our life time is the "Green Earth" movement the planet is tackling. This is a movement that is going to be iconic in this peroid of 2020-2030 the biggest leaps and changes are going to happen in this time span.
It took the world 8 years to go from Horse and Cart to Combustion engine and Personally I don't think we have seen a movement like this since.

  <body>US 10 year yield is spiking. For those with little understanding of economics this means market is pricing in interest rates rising.

Since markets have relied upon an effective interest rate of zero for the past 2 years this is in technical terms a VERY BAD THING for stocks.

Since rates are already zero Chairman Powell can‚Äôt do much more than promise to keep rates at zero. But it seems the market is already starting to lose faith in the fed.</body>

    <body>No, they fuck off outta shares and into interest bearing assets, since they can now park their money in less risky instruments with a noticeable return. I know you're probably thinking "but 1% on a five year term deposit is garbage", and I'd agreed with you, however there's large institutions out there (pension funds, super, govt agencies, endowment funds, etc) that need a slice of that 1% in their portfolio for risk management purposes. Unfortunately that slice is still big enough that when their funds flow out of the share market it causes a noticeable drop</body>

    <body>Doesn‚Äôt really matter about net debt in the company or not. If money can get a better yield in treasuries than risky stocks it will flow to treasuries.

By the time retail punters on the stock market notice it will already be at the point where stocks are being panic dumped, and at the point where fear takes over it doesn‚Äôt matter if fundamentally the company has a great balance sheet or whatever. As much as you saw people FOMOing into whatever name was hot over the last few weeks with no hesitation you‚Äôll see people panic selling their stocks to lock in profit with no hesitation as well.

  <body>My pick for today's overnight hold is COD, a copper miner that commenced trading on ASX in late October 2020. 

IPO price 30c, opening day high 51c and closed at 44c. ATH is still 51c.

**Reasons:**

* Low float: 85mil SOI [disclosed](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-top-20-securityholders.5741276/), I believe that was fully diluted count, as IRESS showing 69mil float. About 10mil of which are under [escrow](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-asx-notice-admission-to-official-list.5710115/). Top 20 holding 48mil as disclosed on 06/11/2020, so leaving the market between 21mil and 37mil shares to trade.
* Huge volume: usual daily volume eyeball at around 100k, IPO day had 1.73mil vol, and today it had 3.7mil vol. Not a huge volume compared to many other hot stocks (looking at you, IOU), but this abnormal spike in trading volume in a single stock usually signals something.
* Mad intra-day gains: like we've seen last week, stocks with decent intraday gains that made it to top gainers list and put them on traders' radar usually have good run on subsequent days, COD made 53% by closing today, 5th on the list.
* Near ATH: after the mad gains today and a strong gap up close from 43.5c at 4pm and closed at 46c, it is now just 5c, or 10 pips away from challenging its 51c ATH.
* "Fundamentals": copper spot price at [52-wk high](https://www.marketindex.com.au/copper) ( u/SpecAnalist may have more valuable input on this topic as he [sounds like he knows this space](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lp8spe/market_open_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gobb4sb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), this may fuel some hype combined with COD's today's [announcement](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-assays-confirm-huge-extent-of-emmie-bluff-cu-mineralisation.5918441/#post-51221418) (idk how to read miners' fundamentals so it could be shit, whoever knows how to read it, tell me if I'm fucked). COD holding [$11.78mil cash](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-december-2020-quarterly-activities-and-cashflow-reports.5878655/) as at 31/12/2020, assuming they haven't burned them all in two months, that's about 1/3 of their current MC of $32mil as at today's closing price.
* Risk/Reward: didn't look at this because I had too much coffee, will sell at market price if I got fucked too hard.</body>
  <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="SpecAnalist" created="2021-02-22 19:30:33+10:00">
   <body>Copper spot price touched 10 year highs today!
A copper supply crunch is here NOW, and its occurring simultaneously with Biden's Green/Renewables mandate and EV revolution.  
EV's use a lot more copper than lithium, cobalt/ anything else and thats not including infrastructure pre car - https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/glencore-ev-needs-1024x313.jpg 

Only a couple of major new Copper discoveries have been made in the last 4yrs and the only major new project coming online in Aus in the next 5yrs is currently RIO's Winu project.

Gold, Lithium, Graphite and Nickel have all there runs through 2020 and I believe Copper will dominate 2021 which is fortunate as all the juniors MCs are still relatively cheap.

COD is definitely in big boy country, Olympic Dam is a beast!
The strike extension is definitely exciting I would just preface that each of those DD holes costs close to $500k and it will be costly to mine down to 400m deep. So hopefully they can find a shitload of Copper down there with the 1,000m deep drill hole in Q2 so Olympic Dam owners BHP can come take them out :)</body>

AXE looks decent too. MXO potentially as well, but no announcement today so it's not clear why it moved so much.</body>

  <comment ups="13" downs="0" author="Doomkoon4648" created="2021-02-22 19:24:20+10:00">
   <body>Hell yes.
Here's a post I put up recently.

So from reading the VML Ann again VML is going to mine out the entirety of the North T zone between March -September and hold in Storage (9000T's REO) So let's say conservative revenue we will have for these 3 years at say $120 mil profit for VML (9000T's x $42Mil Now take out Profit sharing and expenses a conservative target is $120mil) it will be enough REO for 2021-2024 from what I read. SRC later this year will be constructing the Extraction plant to turn all that RE into REO for shipment to REEtec. Now we are only delivering 1000T's of REO to REEtec this year which leaves 8000T's for year 2022-2024 when it's expected to expire.
While this is going on drilling tests are being conducted on the largest Zone.

And all this being debt free.</body>

I'm not selling LKE but I am fully aware the price will drop a little from here before rebounding again upwards.

If you want to try and time the market, good luck! But try not to get burnt.</body>

  <body>EGR was expected to drop a bit further before recovering. It didn't drop as far down which shows a continual confidence in the stock, despite the recent sell off, and ended green despite expectations.  I'm confident in clean lithium stocks that are poised to benefit from EU clean lithium legislation and demand for clean lithium. That's not to say it won't drop again, but it's a definite hold for me.</body>

Hmm I feel far less positive about tomorrow. I expect an overall red day, but with some standout gains in lithium and other mining. Uranium will finally move a bit, but start returning to neutral after lunch. 
Cannabis will drop again. Buy this drop off you're invested.

  <body>Can someone explain the IHL ann that was released after hours? Is it 10mil shares at $0.20 that i can buy into as a holder?
There's also 10mil options that i have no idea about is u/Exalted_HC about?
I have this in my head at 40-50c from a couple of their trials then dual listing on the NYSE could see $1 but i know thats a 1bil MC.</body>

   <body>Dude... those are the options given to EAS Advisors (Eddie Sugar) in renumeration for their services as per the ann.

Not available to buy, for EAS to hold and exercise when they wish to if IHL SP meets their targets.

And yes, 40-50c would be a fair valuation IMO for IHL if they smash the OSA trial and get the nod from the FDA to go ahead with ARDS inhuman, but with US listing that number doubles if not even triples.

Remember how much the US values our peers, as per my DD post. Compass, MindMed, CARA all billion dollar companies in USD. IHL is basically CARA atm but a year behind, and about to launch two psychedelics trials which would make them practically Compass and MindMed combined.</body>

Made a nice 8% day trade on COD announcement today. Hoping GRR keeps pushing tomorrow. Still undervalued at $0.445 but it was a big day with 0.03 up. RNU smashed it for me. BD1 was a nice surprise. Was hoping it would just hold around $2.80-$3.00 but it jumped so much. Everything was green today. Was up 6% for the day. Just an amazing day for me considering Z1P ended only just in front.

  <body>G'day I'm significantly retarded so I don't understand how options work on the ASX. 

I'm on selfwealth so I can see DW8O trading but I don't understand what the strike is and I have no idea if its a call or a put.

How do I determine wtf this option is?</body>
  <comment ups="9" downs="0" author="too_many_wines_" created="2021-02-22 21:03:52+10:00">
   <body>Google "DW8O strike price" - it comes up with the expiry and strike price at the top of the results.

This is not a put/call. It's an option to buy the share. If you buy DW8O you can trade it like a share or pay the strike price and receive a DW8 share.

Puts/calls are totally different and not discussed on this sub much if ever.</body>

   <body>All company listed options on the ASX are options to purchase the underlying share. Typically you can look at any Appendix 2A filling, it'll show all options (listed and unlisted) towards the bottom, usually with their exercise price. DW8 did not do this, but I'll help you out, it's 1.5c. Go forth and gamble you degenerate.</body>

   <body>Yeah I'm also in this one. I'm probably going to just keep holding until their app is released tbh. Today's volumes were a nice change though. Hoping it leads to an announcement to get things moving. Feeling like it's been at 1.5/1.6 forever.</body>

     <body>True, not much hype going on currently. Also standard problem is the amount of shares that need to churn to get it moving. When there's close to 3 billion SOI it's not hard for people to dump millions into the sell queue and halt movement.

See how it holds this week. Be great if it can consolidate at 2c for some confidence.</body>

   <body>I have a bid on at 0.12c. 
I would love it to go down to 0.09 and I will buy more if it does. 

But there second announcement regarding release of software and testing was also promising and unexpected. With the expectation that they can release to a wider customer range after next testing due to be completed end of February.

I think maybe increased share price on the back of this news more than CR</body>
