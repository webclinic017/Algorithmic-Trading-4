   <body>I plan to FOMO into LRS and watch as I lose 10 percent plus trade both ways when I sell them FOMO into jxt and do the same, then FOMO into XST  and it drops again then sell for another loss and then FOMO into BD1.

ALL within 30 minutes from opening and end up with 50% loss.</body>

       <body>Yeppers. Sometimes I buy the open and flip it within first 15 mins. Usually tho, I buy during the previous day either somewhere in the dip or at the close and sell the open or within 15 mins. Either way, very few stocks are a buy in the first 15 to 30 for me. Sell the spikes, buy the dips. This is momentum trading tho. Long term good stocks are kinder.</body>

   <body>In with RAC (2.28), LKE (0.36), AV1 (0.21) &amp; XST (0.0215 should have waited til today cursing that FOMO) holding all, no plans to jump for 12 - 18 months unless really bad news.. next step Z1P or IOU vs top of of one of the above at a discount (LKE/AV1/XST) or RAC even though averaging up I think has good potential even at its current price.  Will probably go for Z1P if it dips tomorrow as looks another good longer term option.</body>

  <body>Ok here is for the weak hearted:

XST- yes it will dip as people are offered to buy this at 0.008. But we will get an influx of buyers which will raise the price back to 0.018 which I imagine most of you bought it at including me, especially with upcoming announcements.
I regret not buying my trusty stocks when I got letters to buy for cheap prices!

LKE- don’t even worry bruh LKE always comes back. I topped up at this great buying opportunity. Load up tomorrow on sale day. Red day is sale day for LKE. Long term hold when lithium demand for electric cars rises.

BPH- long term hold, delay an approval doesn’t mean it won’t go ahead, and even without approval it still has other projects, take a look. Once they start you’ll see another pump and next time you’ll be prepared.

Relax guys. Not every day is a green day. I’ve seen my portfolio in the red 50% and rise back up to gains. Stocks USUALLY go up in the long run as long as companies are still conducting business.</body>

      <body>Yeppers. Sometimes I buy the open and flip it within first 15 mins. Usually tho, I buy during the previous day either somewhere in the dip or at the close and sell the open or within 15 mins. Either way, very few stocks are a buy in the first 15 to 30 for me. Sell the spikes, buy the dips. This is momentum trading tho. Long term good stocks are kinder.</body>

  <body>SGC 

SGC sell-off explained: https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-appendix-2a-placement-of-shares.5901491/

Tldr: announcement released showing shares were issued yesterday to Sophs (looks like some dumped for quick gains)

That along with the chain reaction of panic selling and a red asx day etc. Atleast we know what's going on now and where we stand.

I have high hopes looking at the updates posted on the Twitter account of Sacgasco : 
https://mobile.twitter.com/SacGasCo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor

I think these are great times to get in if you haven't already (massive dips and prices you wished to buy in at before the rise). You may want to wait to be sure you're not catching a falling knife (reversal of downtrend).

I think you should hold if you are already in (SGC OR XST) and do not panic sell for a loss. You may hate yourself for doing that in a few weeks time. If things go to plan then in a few months time these companies can multibag (keyword is "if" , nothing is guaranteed and only gamble what you can afford to lose).

All of this hype and the only thing that happened was the drilling rig arrived on site. They still need to drill , tell us what they found , and update us each step of the way on the progress (aka there will be a lot of announcements upcoming). Theres really a lot of positive things coming our way. 

Disclaimer: I am balls deep in SGC at an average of 0.1013

Note: XST and SGC are partners and if one succeeds both succeed. Were in this together fam !</body>

  <body>Right ...
Vic is in lockdown.
I ruined my breakfast. 
And ended up 7k down from where I was last Friday. 

So time to get a lil silly...
Put on the Pikachu onesy and fight the local Ibis over who has rights to shit in the park fountain. 

Reminds me of a story I was on a boat and punched a seagull... Cunt was trying to steal my chips and I launched a haymaker from the other side of the street. 
He reacted but a little late... And to be fair I was drunk... Hit him on the beak.
If my aim was a little better I'd have fukn launched him over the harbour bridge. 

Anyway... Captain Cook cruises hasn't allowed me back since.</body>

So far we have
1. ARDS (IHL-675A)
2. OSA (IHL-42X)
3. TBI (IHL-216A)
4. Psilocybin

The 5th Is likely Asthma/COPD related.

  <body>So I've been playing around with my screener on Tradingview and have come across HFY, an "enterprise solutions provider" which I don't think I've ever seen mentioned here but has some pretty eye-popping stats... might do a DD post on them but:

* Only stock on the whole ASX with a ROE over 70 (wtf?)
* P/E of 12 for a penny stock
* They just released their half year update which mentions: "Annualised recurring revenue (ARR) currently at $11.5m, a 49% increase on the FY20 recurring revenues ($7.7m) and now represents 63% of total sales revenue", which means it's not one-off sales warping the numbers

that's strong as fuck for a penny, gonna dive deeper tonight...</body>

   <body>Looking at the depth can be misleading just for future reference.. sell side can be stacked right up the price line to give the illusion of a downward push.

But yea there is added pressure on VML atm use of options hasn't helped.</body>

Time to do a scan of companies under $60 mill MC and see what the ratio is of companies that have risen over the last 12 months and those that haven't. Get rid of the companies with &lt;5c sp and pick the ones in the hot sectors. During the peaks of bull markets, all the speccy penny stocks start to pop and certain hot sectors start their parabolic rise. Gotta be getting into that territory right about now? funk soul brother.</body>

Unfortunately we shedding a heap of those guys that bought in on the spp and are now immediately selling for 300% profits. 

I mean they did just exercise options for 10mln shares at a strike price of 0.5c
And 500 mln shares to "sophisticated investors"

Im holding and my reasoning is that nothing has changed in terms of the decision whether it’s tomorrow or later due to the extension. Sure I expect the sp to go down whilst we await a decision, but I’m still confident and if you got in early enough IF it were to not get approved they do still have potential with the cortical venture.

   <body>Great interview.  Good find 👌

 Brandon Munro is a massive spokesperson for the uranium industry. Super intelligent guy and connected worldwide with experts. And well respected. So it's no wonder it was so easy for him to raise the capital from the fund groups.

 He is on a podcast weekly where they provide  an update on the uranium market and industry and what's coming up.

 The Crux Investor  - by Matt Gordan  is the podcast
Really good podcast and covers other commodities weekly. Highly recommend

Podcast is free but if you sign up to their closed group, let Matt know I sent you.


 Another podcast the Azarias Capital  podcast will provide a breakdown on the whole market dynamics (supply, demand, inventory and factors).</body>

Kicking myself for not jumping in at 16c but happy for all the autists here who did!!! Was tossing up whether to buy in to IOU, IHL or NVA and ultimately went with a bunch of IHL which I don't regret at all! 

Hoping the IHL TH produces the goods.

  <body>I just listened to Kieth Pitt on ABC Radio this morning talking about PEP11 (BPH and BUY). I am as convinced as I could possibly be that he will approve the NOPTA permit. 

[https://www.abc.net.au/radio/sydney/programs/breakfast/breakfast/13128106](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/sydney/programs/breakfast/breakfast/13128106) 

Segment starts at 1:30.

I have just bought so much BPH and BPHOA it's almost (almost ;) ) financially irresponsible.

Good luck everyone.</body>

  <body>Rickle buying a stock and then spruiking it - with the intention of selling into the demand that said spruiking could have stimulated - hmmmm. Lots of peeps in the fin industry are doing exactly that - but they cover their asses by stating that material is for entertainment purposes only. Or not to be taken as fin advice. It's hard enough being preyed on by the fin industry without fellow apes joining in. People that back up their DD with a HC link - a poor retard that has lost its way? A nefarious link into the Matrix? I made a list of sneaky mofo's during the EM1 debacle on HC. So many dropped their cover during that moment in time. Shame we don't get to see a username's previous usernames. That would probably surprise a few. AI can scan text and tell if the same person wrote it under a different name. Mods in HC work for the industry. Hell, they are the industry. Mods here are deadset Legends.</body>

  <body>Mixed bag for me today. Like most, started the day very well but ended up in the red.

I hold too many stocks now to list them all but special mentions to

JXT, LRS 🚀🚀 - reasonably new holdings for me so enjoying the ride.

FYI  - guess the news was priced in with the recent run up (I’m not sure it was) but finished ok to be only down 5% on the day.


SRK, SHE - not an ideal start to the campaign down close to 20% within days so expecting to average down when things settle. 

New holding VRX and have my eye on NWC for tomorrow.</body>

  <body>I keep waiting for RNT to dip so i can top up a bit but it just doesn't happen. I'm guessing every other cunt is doing the same so it never really drops. May just have to suck it up and go in at 29c.</body>

  <body>Been a great week for me, have no cash so have avoided the recent pumps, but two of my bag-holds have gone \~30% green (3DP and Z1P) and my darling IHL is crushing it and will continue with the ann next Tuesday.

NVA however continues to disappoint but its a small holding and I can wait.</body>

   <body>Having lived around S.E.A for work, I feel like people are underestimating how much of a foothold Grab already has on the market. I used Grab for everything, ordering groceries, rides, food, movie tickets/entertainment etc. They recently launched a BNPL feature in Singapore and I believe they will start rolling it out throughout S.E.A soon.

IOU looks good on paper until you realise how much big competition they have to overcome in the region.

Edit: Not saying it won’t rocket in the short term though.</body>
