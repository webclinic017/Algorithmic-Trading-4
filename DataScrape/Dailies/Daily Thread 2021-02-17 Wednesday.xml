   <body> BPH is looking like a roller coaster after the opposition to extend the permit. Though the resources minister looks like maintaining support for the gas project. Who knows where this is going to go. I sold mine a week or so ago and invested in foreign gas companies that do not have the environmental and NIMBY problems on the New South Wales coast. If they oppose these projects, instead of achieving their aims, investors just look at interstate and overseas gas companies and stocks, either on ASX or foreign stock exchange listed where there is less opposition. If the project is approved, BPH would likely rocket again though.</body>

  <body>IOU - as expected, a sharp sell off followed by aggressive buying. There’s a minimum of $150m of bids which weren’t filled in the raise. Pros would have sold to spook retail, swiped and now the rise it back. Still seeing $1+ especially with rumors floating of news next week. 

Z1P - 20% swing from lows today. Some amazing buying opportunities for the brave ones. I feel this was the last shakeout and we will stabilize around the 12-14 next few days, with a rise into the half yearly results next week. I’m expecting to settle around the 15 mark, and then upwards to $20 on results. 

KSS - pro money keeps entering on the quiet. My sleeper stock &gt; no one talking about it, company is quietly achieving goals and building to a 300m MC company by end of year based on predicted revenue. 

US futures looking green, should warrant a strong close today and hopefully a strong end of week, which would be bullish especially for BNPL majors Z1P and APT going into reporting next week. 

Good luck and agressive trading cunts.</body>

  <body>Over 65 BNPL's as of today- most, are crap. Made a list and then got bored of adding new ones each week so, this is an older (5 weeks ago) list that is missing many names.

Addi, Affirm, Afterpay, Alipay, Bread, Brighte, Beforepay, Billease, Bundll, Cashalo, Douugh, EmpatKali, Finzi, Finme, Flipkart, Flexpay, Grab, Gopay, Hoola, Humm, ISentric, Jungle, Klarna, Latitude Pay, Lazy Pay, Laybuy, Limepay, Open Pay, Paidy, Paypal, Paytam Postpaid, Credit Payright, Sezzle, Slice, Simpl, Split, Splitit, Tendopay, Uplift, Zestmoney, Zebit, Zip.

Some people keep mentioning that the number doesn't matter because there are thousands of banks on earth. Hmm, trouble is that the thousands of banks aren't giving junkies free credit like afterpay is so, you really can't compare the two.</body>

I've only put around 4k in, sitting just over 6k now but feel it's not enough to diversify *too* much so only have 1-1.5k in 3 different stocks (LKE, AV1, PEN).

  <body>Copied from end of last thread

Details of Uranium miner ☢️☢️☢️ DYL Cap Raise just dropped

They have raised $40.8 mill from institutions at $0.65 per share (~63 mill shares)

Current shares outstanding is ~256 mill at $0.84 with a market cap of $215 mill 

Therefore 256\*0.84 + 63*0.65 = ~$256 mill new Market cap with "dumb" share price of (256 / (63+256)) = $0.8

Of course, this fast share placement from institutional investors is a bullish sign, so I'd expect good things today, might even crack the mystic $1 mark if we're really lucky.

Edit: Never mind, market thinks different lol</body>

  <body>I bought both CI1 (a couple of months ago) and HFY based on the same filtering process in screening tools, would not be surprised if HFY ends up copping the same treatment at some point down the track seeing they have similar strong fundamentals for penny stocks.

You just don't see small companies with financials *that* strong on the ASX very often that aren't small-scale gold miners and the like...

To be honest though this rocket is kind of annoying, cause I always wanted to long-term hold it and now it's skewed the value all over the place, heh.</body>

   <body>There are approx 1.2b shares on issue, they would more than likely get burnt themselves trying to pump it up. They also have half the issued shares as ADN, it is possible if the announcement is as good as the early samples/scans indicate the share price could jump to similar levels as seen with ADN announcement. Offloading 4.5m shares at this stage would be filled relatively quickly as buyer interest increases and not really result in a dump that would tank the share price. This is purely speculation but with the current issued shares and mkt capt 4.5m is relatively insignificant and this would also be the case if share price climbs to similar levels as seen with AND.</body>

   <body>It was projected in their late Nov announcement that it would be minimum of 4 months to get testing results from NVX. That brings us to the end of March. Also indicated that results are expected in March quarter. Interview in late January indicated a few months/3months for testing results.

Edit - the “end of feb consensus” isn’t documented anywhere that I can find. Happy to be proven wrong on that, as I would love for it to be sooner. But as far as I can tell, it’s a rumor perhaps by autists that can’t add 4 months from the end of Nov.</body>

Good buy in the short term. Probably sell at $1 then wait for another drop</body>

    <body>- BPH needs approval for PEP11 offshore drilling.
- People have been guessing thats imminent for weeks, meaning the share price have been on a rollercoaster.
- John Barilaro (Deputy Premier NSW) came out yesterday saying he won't support it after being "consulted".
- Thing is JB has no fucking say in it. It all comes down to Keith Pitt (Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia).
- So people like me assume JB has come out with his statement to wash his hands of the final decision, which he knows will be approval by KP. 
- If we're right, rocket (in theory)
- If we're wrong, fuck.</body>

  <body> BPH is looking like a roller coaster after the opposition to extend the permit. Though the resources minister looks like maintaining support for the gas project. Who knows where this is going to go. I sold mine a week or so ago and invested in foreign gas companies that do not have the environmental and NIMBY problems on the New South Wales coast. If they oppose these projects, instead of achieving their aims, investors just look at interstate and overseas gas companies and stocks, either on ASX or foreign stock exchange listed where there is less opposition. If the project is approved, BPH would likely rocket again though.</body>
