   <body>Kinda  pissed that NIC had to release their "part of the nickel EV supply  chain" announcement amidst Friday's global bloodbath, such a waste of  rocket fuel üôÑ

plus I was flat out at work and didn't even get time to buy the dip

also be interested in seeing how CI1 performs post-cap-raise, probably drop back down to 4c or so</body>

    <body>Feels like increasing fees is a cheap way to get YoY revenue numbers up in place of active user growth which is more organic, so I don't like it. Prefer SWF for investing in this space.
But I'm also bitter as I'm one of those shmucks who has to pay the extra $1/month now</body>

It‚Äôs true there is little to no support underneath TSLA price.

Not a lot of bright news for TSLA at moment. May need some strong Bitcoin approbation to shore up the share price.</body>

       <body>The man's been shorting APT, Tesla and NASDAQ since mid-2020. You'll get a correction eventually.

Like, come on man. I called the drop last week, no point shorting an exuberant market until there is reasonable incentive, otherwise you're more likely to go insolvent.

        <body>I‚Äôd argue that 7 months is a rather solid timeframe from talks of a correction to fruition. Does the fact that the housing market hasn‚Äôt corrected change the indicators real estate valuations in Australia are are overinflated?

Edit: I can‚Äôt speak the solvency of his obviously, but I absolutely agree that if you constantly fought against a raging market that you‚Äôd send yourself in to a rough position incredibly quickly</body>

         <body>7 months. The biggest bull run in history. 

My entire investing group has gone at least 300%+ during this period and this guy has been bleeding out. 

We started taking bearish hedges when the NASDAQ dipped below the 50-day EMA as you should, and what he should have done, instead of fighting the market.</body>

        <body>Much like other conversations that have been had around here, I think stimulus from US has been priced in ages ago, so while a short burn of positive sentiment might carry through the morning or even day perhaps, I don‚Äôt see any large fundamental changes on a macro level that would suggest a longer term staving off of what we saw last week. Given the recent monstrous spike in housing prices due to cash being so cheap coupled with unemployment not going anywhere, along with social nets ending this month, I‚Äôd say the turbulence in the market is just starting</body>

        <body>Yeah - it will be interesting to see over the next couple of months which way it goes. If the markets fall, people may turn to BTC as very few people know how to do anything but go long. If inflation picks up, fiat could be deserted by more people. Its purchasing power is dropping over time and printing more and more isn't helping any.</body>

Followed a ‚Äòhot tip‚Äô from a friend about MPH, and long story short covid completely fucked it. Have held for a little over a year now and still in the red 75%... it‚Äôs my biggest loss by far, but I can‚Äôt stomach selling for such a big loss. There are tax benefits for holding stocks for over a year before realising profits... is there any advantage for holding for over a year to realise a loss? Thoughts?</body>

    <body>Nope, all a capital loss.

       <body>I never miss an opp to stir the pot. I contacted ASIC a few years back when a scam ad was running - orion something. They were using James Packers photo and a supposed quote from him. It kept coming up when I surfed the net so I contacted ASIC, did heaps of legwork for them, and they did nothing. Couldn't be bothered. Peeps getting scammed left right and centre but even the regulatory body that exists to protect people can't be bothered. PPPfffft.</body>

  <body>What a week - thank fuk that is over. Spoke to a couple of old Boomer customers this week about the stock market. We talked about the amount of cash going into markets via jobkeeper, Jobseeker, new generation of workers, the amount of superann money having to be invested and the options open to everyone to invest. We are at a point in history where 3 generations of people are working, getting super, looking for returns and all have the ability to invest. No one can get a return just parking money in a savings acct so it's not surprising that valuations are thru the roof. Markets are getting volatile as seen by the large swings up and down over the last week. I sold off most holdings at the start of the week because I wasn't able to watch the markets - think I got lucky there. I'm wondering how many people are not in the markets? Who is left that is willing to buy and push prices even higher? Super funds have Billions every week that need a home but they mainly stick to top 200 or 300 companies. With that in mind, I expect further gains in those top 200 or 300 companies for a little while but I'm not so sure about the rest of the stocks in the market. As such, I am looking at trading only those top 300 for momentum trades using larger amounts of money and chasing smaller % gains and leaving the rest alone. March, April, May are usually weak months. See what happens.

TL;DR - Markets may take a breather over next couple of months.</body>

      <body>The man's been shorting APT, Tesla and NASDAQ since mid-2020. You'll get a correction eventually.

Like, come on man. I called the drop last week, no point shorting an exuberant market until there is reasonable incentive, otherwise you're more likely to go insolvent.

       <body>I‚Äôd argue that 7 months is a rather solid timeframe from talks of a correction to fruition. Does the fact that the housing market hasn‚Äôt corrected change the indicators real estate valuations in Australia are are overinflated?

        <body>7 months. The biggest bull run in history. 

My entire investing group has gone at least 300%+ during this period and this guy has been bleeding out. 

We started taking bearish hedges when the NASDAQ dipped below the 50-day EMA as you should, and what he should have done, instead of fighting the market.</body>

      <body>Thanks mate, I appreciate that. 

You may be right. I don‚Äôt want to count my chickens before they hatch but. 

This week will be another interesting one. Probably a strong start on the ‚Äústimulus‚Äù news, but like last week maybe the green will quickly fade?</body>

       <body>Much like other conversations that have been had around here, I think stimulus from US has been priced in ages ago, so while a short burn of positive sentiment might carry through the morning or even day perhaps, I don‚Äôt see any large fundamental changes on a macro level that would suggest a longer term staving off of what we saw last week. Given the recent monstrous spike in housing prices due to cash being so cheap coupled with unemployment not going anywhere, along with social nets ending this month, I‚Äôd say the turbulence in the market is just starting</body>

       <body>Yeah - it will be interesting to see over the next couple of months which way it goes. If the markets fall, people may turn to BTC as very few people know how to do anything but go long. If inflation picks up, fiat could be deserted by more people. Its purchasing power is dropping over time and printing more and more isn't helping any.</body>

\- The company draws your attention to the legislation that says that the decision is the Minister's not the PMs.

\- The company draws your attention to the previous comments of the Minister as set out in previous announcements.

  <body>Okay so question for Uranium and PENis lovers.

PENMF was down 8% to 0.88c last trading day in the US. its equivalent to 10c AUD.

Is it fair to say that whatever happens in the US- PEN will follow?</body>

   <body>Not sure where you're getting your currency conversions/prices from

I've got PENMF at 0.082 USD = 0.11 AUD

Also in the past they've been similar, but not always identical, i.e. small fluctuations above and below eachother</body>

  <body>Need Monday to be good. I've decided I want to unload a lot of my portfolio and dump larger volumes into less stocks.

I'm thinking of reducing to 6

**PEN** - Genuine stonk, can only go up    
**BPH** - Diamond handing until it loves me    
**VAL** - Can't sell the fucker because no buyers    
**IBG** - Feel it's going to be great    
**LRS** - Is great, I know this will be my bag leader    
**CXL** - Currently don't have, but it's my most thought out stock that I strongly believe in. The majority of my selling should go here.

Would love to hear people's opinion on these guys, and what you would likely swap.

      <body>Hahaha tomato tomato. Same Chairman as EM1 so I was close. 

I will say VR1 appears to be the best of a bad bunch, but I‚Äôm extremely unsurprised that it‚Äôs finally dumping. No way was it worth over $100M on what they currently have or might reasonably grow into soon.</body>

  <body>LRS: Hold. Undervalued, nothing indicating it won't return to 10c and pass it once JORC is done. Already bought 4 dips and I'm out of investment cash.

MNS: Hold. Looking really strong into the rest of 2021 thanks to supercharged progress in setting up the gigawatt EV battery plant, and a very proactive ex-Tesla CEO in pinging major US car manufacturers to sell the 'US energy supply chain' dream.

If they actually secure interest Ford Motors to be the first major customer, that'll be a quick re-rate to a $1-2b valuation, or 6-7-bagger for those who entered below 30c. Very resilient to the general markets so just as before, very bullish on project success now that they're actually delivering truck loads of new equipment to install on a DAILY basis.</body>

  <body>I have made a couple of little silly fomo purchases lately, but to this date the worst stock I have purchased remains my first. Followed a ‚Äòhot tip‚Äô from a friend about MPH, and long story short covid completely fucked it. Have held for a little over a year now and still in the red 75%... it‚Äôs my biggest loss by far, but I can‚Äôt stomach selling for such a big loss. There are tax benefits for holding stocks for over a year before realising profits... is there any advantage for holding for over a year to realise a loss? Thoughts?</body>

   <body>Nope, all a capital loss.

  <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="cant_right_good" created="2021-03-07 20:12:43+10:00">
   <body>Feels like increasing fees is a cheap way to get YoY revenue numbers up in place of active user growth which is more organic, so I don't like it. Prefer SWF for investing in this space.
But I'm also bitter as I'm one of those shmucks who has to pay the extra $1/month now</body>

  <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="FameLuck" created="2021-03-07 19:51:14+10:00">
   <body>Why?</body>
   <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="KStock2" created="2021-03-07 19:54:47+10:00">
    <body>PKS had a investor webinar on Friday and announced they have some big ticket deals that will be announced over the next few weeks when finalised

TYR has hit a lot of resistance around the 3.12 and seems to not want to sell under that price. At the time been, if you can get in at that price or maybe slightly below, will definitely make a return. TYR also is beginning to really increase their market share percentage.</body>

      <body>I‚Äôm just telling ya, PKS is a sleeping giant. I‚Äôm not sure why not many people are onto it yet. Watch the investor webinar posted on their website, 30 minute video and those 30 minutes might be a very valuable investment within itself.</body>
