   <body>Tryna decide whether to sell MEM at a 40% less or double down. The announcement stated they found an engineering problem in their IVF tech which they have stated to be solvable, just requiring more time (and money) meaning production is pushed back. This tech could really be revolutionary to the fertility field but I suppose the tech sell off and impatient share holders expecting production in April caused a big price drop. Anyone else holding have any thoughts?</body>

Greens across the board even with the arvo sell off. 

SRK - flat but holding, low volumes waiting for that spark
IXR - the real deal. Powering through those CR sellers and coiling up pre-scoping study
TMZ - bit yuck, being toyed with at close everyday is frustrating
SHE - oil is 🚀🚀🚀 macro fundamentals also super supportive, and cashflow positive nanocap junior = no brainer

   <body>EGR - Days like today convince me that my original trading strategy of selling for pips and buying dips is the correct way. "Lost" 10k today on paper (could have made 10k if sold on open and then bought back at my original buy in at close).

Let's hope im wrong and going long pays off better, with a bit of patience.

Currently sitting on pretty much break even +0.75%

My original strategy's downfall is that you can sell for pips and then suddenly the stock rockets to xxxx% and you missed out on the "real" tendies. It only works if you are content with the strategy and smaller gains, and not be bothered if the stock rockets (otherwise you spend your days saying "I'm so dumb , why did I sell , etc etc)" and it fucks with your brain. Other times it causes you to buy back in at ATH and then lose your original gains and more.

Let's wait and see how this goes. Have confidence with the stock so that helps</body>

  <body>Not trying to humblebrag while others are hurting, but was actually a pretty strong green day for me thanks to all my metals stonks...

I do miss the days when NVX was a "bagger" though, it's gone from up 100+% to just 22%, pretty big fall from grace but was always a long term hold so we shall see 💘

stay strong peeps!</body>

   <body>Same with VUL. At its peak I had 400%. Now its sitting at about 80%.

Its tough to watch but I bought in because I like the company not the stock itself. Ive been watching NVX recently and I really like the company. Been waiting to buy in at the right time.</body>

    <body>Yeah, the only time I look to invest in companies that aren't profitable are when they are producing something *I actually really want to see in the world*, e.g: better battery technology is something I've wanted for years and years, so willing to put cash behind NVX in the hope that it becomes reality 🤞

Same reason I've been tempted by RAC despite it going against my usual strategy (haven't pulled the trigger though)</body>

  <body>Recent weeks are making me question if selling stocks for say 30% and then moving on would be the better option as opposed to holding long term... Watching profits slip away as I wait for announcements is giving me the bluest of balls.</body>
  <comment ups="9" downs="0" author="sulmar" created="2021-03-08 19:24:37+10:00">
   <body>Not really sure what to think of this honestly. I was holding NYR and I sold at 20% profit (4k profit seemed pretty awesome at the time). Not 2 weeks later, it went to a ATH and I missed out on potentially making 20k over the 4k.

So anyways couple of weeks later, was holding Vr1 and was in the profit over 3k, but thought not making the same mistake. That stock started falling like no tomorrow and i had to sell for a loss of 3k (lucky I did or else I woulda copped it massive since it has fallen so much since then).

Moral of the story: I've got no fucking idea.</body>

   <body>It depends. Most stocks recover from those pullbacks when the broader market sinks or when they have profit taking, and then can go beyond that 30% if the fundamentals are there, though it can take a while. Most of the time after something like a 30% gain profits will start receding, it just depends on your time frame what you wanna do. I know for a fact if I sell at 30% profit the stock will rocket more, but if I don't sell it will crash so idek what to do.</body>

   <body>I did that from Mar - Sep last year.  Gains were then completely wiped out by 2 messed up trades (and I also regret not holding a bunch).

Since Sep moved majority to a holding position - still have some gamblers I flip at 20% but thats just some spare change doing the 40 trades to a Mill.

Sitting on about +48% overall (including the belting from the past month) from what I bought Sep and held.</body>

  <body>EGR - Days like today convince me that my original trading strategy of selling for pips and buying dips is the correct way. "Lost" 10k today on paper (could have made 10k if sold on open and then bought back at my original buy in at close).

Let's hope im wrong and going long pays off better, with a bit of patience.

Currently sitting on pretty much break even +0.75%

My original strategy's downfall is that you can sell for pips and then suddenly the stock rockets to xxxx% and you missed out on the "real" tendies. It only works if you are content with the strategy and smaller gains, and not be bothered if the stock rockets (otherwise you spend your days saying "I'm so dumb , why did I sell , etc etc)" and it fucks with your brain. Other times it causes you to buy back in at ATH and then lose your original gains and more.

Let's wait and see how this goes. Have confidence with the stock so that helps</body>

  <body>Tryna decide whether to sell MEM at a 40% less or double down. The announcement stated they found an engineering problem in their IVF tech which they have stated to be solvable, just requiring more time (and money) meaning production is pushed back.

   <body>Asia might keep sliding. I checked for a nice bounce this morning when everything was bright green but it didn't do shit. It used to push harder with blood on the streets than it did this morning.

Tech isn't the play right now. Follow the trends (for ETFs: FOOD, and if you want to diversify fairly safely then QFN and BNKS until people get an appetite for technology again. If you want Asia style risk and growth then you have to go to the US markets and get msos or one of the mining ones, because hack/acdc/whatever are all dogshit in this climate)

    <body>Haven't I crucified every person on this sub for pumping biopharma? 

No idea why I would ever touch that. As soon as anyone says it's an $X,000,0000,000 market then you know straight away it's 97% of the time a P&amp;D.</body>

    <body>nope... i have no idea to be honest, I was hoping someone had picked up something I had missed as to why they're diving... in my eyes it's an opportunity to lower my average entry price but im wondering if im hanging on to a loser because im missing something</body>

  <body>Got a few quick questions baout BBOZ/BBUS if anyone has used them before and can help a brother out. what's the liquidity like? say it goes up %4, is kit hard to sell at the end of day?

And is it even worth doing in small amounts, like is T+2 ing it a bad idea coz of the brokering costs?</body>
  <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="Goody55" created="2021-03-08 19:21:18+10:00">
   <body>Bboz is always liquid, the fund makes buy in/out always available. Youll see how it works in the buy/sell quotes, theres 90k shares available to sell and buy at each pip

EDIT: Cant comment on T+2 plays but there was a very good post about 3 weeks ago on this sub which talked about how this fund deteriorates over time making it a bad long term play</body>

   <body>I would not touch BB series unless you absolutely know the stock market is going down the next day. Better off finding a stock that has gone up too much and find puts on it. So many peeps have tried to make money on BB series and failed. But hey, have a crack - and post the loss or gain porn?</body>

  <body>So, what do we make of Money Magazine’s hypothesis on Swick Mining SWK...?
The skinny:
• Valued at less than 50% of net assets;
• Market currently valuing them as a mining services co with poor prospects;
• That part of the business is actually going ok;
• Currently commercialising technology called Orexplore which is a CT scanning tech for onsite analysis of core samples letting their customers plan their mines more effectively. 
• At current share price you’re basically getting the Orexplore potential upside for free.</body>
