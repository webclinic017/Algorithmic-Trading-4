    <body>Tbh, the way it fell today I don't know.... Almost feels like insider something something. A massive sell-off in a very short period of time usually isn't a good sign. By short period, I mean it only took 30 minutes or so for it to drop 20%+</body>

   <body>OMFG LKE/NVX announcement finally out

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positive results returned from initial testing by Novonix (ASX:NVX) for high-performance lithium-ion batteries using Lake’s high 99.97% purity lithium carbonate.
• Novonix compared commercial product to Lake’s lithium product to provide real-world comparisons for Tier 1 battery makers.
• Lake’s lithium carbonate performing better than commercially available battery grade lithium carbonate in lithium-ion battery cells.
• Novonix program to continue for some months to produce cells and batteries at a larger scale.

Lake’s high purity lithium carbonate results have been obtained via a simple flowsheet without any anticipated changes to the operating costs previously forecast in Kachi’s Pre-Feasibility Study (refer ASX announcement 30 April 2020). Low impurities are a key factor in determining battery quality and the pricing and acceptance of lithium products. Lake’s high purity carbonate offers the potential for premium prices.
Managing Director Steve Promnitz commented: “The results from Novonix demonstrate the high quality of Lake’s high purity lithium in batteries and future results are anticipated to reinforce the initial results. This provides electric vehicle makers and battery makers confidence around Lake’s product quality, which is particularly important given the increasing demand for a high purity product.
“Lake is advancing the Kachi DFS amid a growing focus on sustainability and the need for a responsibly sourced product suitable for the supply chains of leading EV makers. With investor and industry engagement intensifying, Lake is in an excellent position to progress our product and unlock increased value for shareholders.”</body>

     <body>I hold both buy and bph.
Buy investors seem less emotional as it doesn't fluctuate as much as bph, but for the sole reason they bph can increase its exposure to pep11 shortly, I'd through any fresh money into Bph.

     <body>I've seen some good arguments that BUY is the better buy when it comes PEP-11. BUY is also a goer if you see gas as big part of the energy mix to 2050 (which I do). 

For myself I like BPH as a long term hold given their diverse interests.

Both will absolutely tank if approval isn't received. People probably have way too high expectations for the SP if approval is received. I just want to see a re-rate and I'll hold.</body>

  <body>OMFG LKE/NVX announcement finally out

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positive results returned from initial testing by Novonix (ASX:NVX) for high-performance lithium-ion batteries using Lake’s high 99.97% purity lithium carbonate.
• Novonix compared commercial product to Lake’s lithium product to provide real-world comparisons for Tier 1 battery makers.
• Lake’s lithium carbonate performing better than commercially available battery grade lithium carbonate in lithium-ion battery cells.
• Novonix program to continue for some months to produce cells and batteries at a larger scale.

Lake’s high purity lithium carbonate results have been obtained via a simple flowsheet without any anticipated changes to the operating costs previously forecast in Kachi’s Pre-Feasibility Study (refer ASX announcement 30 April 2020). Low impurities are a key factor in determining battery quality and the pricing and acceptance of lithium products. Lake’s high purity carbonate offers the potential for premium prices.
Managing Director Steve Promnitz commented: “The results from Novonix demonstrate the high quality of Lake’s high purity lithium in batteries and future results are anticipated to reinforce the initial results. This provides electric vehicle makers and battery makers confidence around Lake’s product quality, which is particularly important given the increasing demand for a high purity product.
“Lake is advancing the Kachi DFS amid a growing focus on sustainability and the need for a responsibly sourced product suitable for the supply chains of leading EV makers. With investor and industry engagement intensifying, Lake is in an excellent position to progress our product and unlock increased value for shareholders.”</body>

   <body>Umm I literally posted my GRR DD yesterday and it was 12.5% up today. And it has been posted before. And you could have gotten in just after open for $0.510, close at $0.585. I topped up at $0.34 once with this.

And don’t get me started on VML, up 38% today. Was down to 0.04 about a week and a half ago when I topped up.

RHY up since I first saw it here, Z1P up. EGR I made a killing on, sold for $1.05. VUL I made a heap on also. I just didn’t sell quick enough. 

Ohh wow I nearly forgot RNU. Omg how good has that been, and probably still will. I’m 61% up and kept averaging up.

Edit. This sub is going to feed good and bad. You just need to sort it out. No one can do all the work for you. And you should look at your portfolio as a team effort. Some might be down for a bit but you need to have faith in your own evaluations of the shares. Work out how much you think the MC can go to. Then watch the graph and try to get the Best Buy in. Don’t ever have fomo and don’t get emotional. 

PS also “Sir, this is a casino.”</body>

    <body>I've noticed doing a DD legitimately pumps a stock the next day. It's happened so much I don't know if it's a coincidence.</body>

     <body>Although I agree that a DD post here usually sees the DD'ed stock goes up the next trading session, but I wouldn't say GRR DD pumped it up. GRR had gone up on Friday on the back of a dividend announcement, and it was still undervalued given it's earnings were 1/3 of it's MC as at Friday's close, so today's rise wasn't purely on hype. Also, a $300k buy order wiped the sell wall at 53c this morning at 10.07am, it provides a solid base for the share price to hike on, as the resistance suddenly become a new support.</body>
     <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="Almighti3" created="2021-03-01 19:17:58+10:00">
      <body>This is correct. GRR also had 8m shares traded today. At around an average of $0.55. That’s $4,400,000. Somehow I don’t think my DD with less than 50 likes changed the days trading at all. We are but baby fish in an ocean of sharks.</body>

    <body>I've seen some good arguments that BUY is the better buy when it comes PEP-11. BUY is also a goer if you see gas as big part of the energy mix to 2050 (which I do). 

For myself I like BPH as a long term hold given their diverse interests.

Both will absolutely tank if approval isn't received. People probably have way too high expectations for the SP if approval is received. I just want to see a re-rate and I'll hold.</body>

   <body>You can check my history, every time I bother posting in the daily thread I mention I’m holding. I averaged down when it was $0.040 the other week also. 

Ohh and when I said it was going to rocket in one of the daily threads and a guy asked why because they are going to keep pushing more shares and I forgot to respond to him to tell him the extra 20% shares a year is not even an issue with the small market cap. 

VML could be LYC in two or three years. Don’t know what that guy was smoking but the MC was and still is so low compared to say LYC, that it’s just a no brainer.</body>

There is some JV issues that CHK are working through currently but they are progressively working their way through drilling/exploring.  


What swayed me into getting into CHK was the location of the asset - it sits right next the BHP Olympic and Oak Dam sites so we know there is Cu in the ground. Partnership or takeover from BHP is the target exit for me personally.</body>

I also like IMA at 15c

or RrL at below $3.20

i also like VR1.

also PAM 15c

there is probably better else where but to get a bump up and jump out or  VR1 wait for it . I think this is going to go gang busters at some point with real value but you still need to trade it like any other trade. RRL is more of a big place to sit and jump out. AISCS aren't that crash hot at $1500 g/t Au and same as AIS but has Cu also</body>

   <body>Too many “partnerships” not enough revenue. Partnerships don’t equal revenue, at best they represent a path to future revenue, but that hasn’t materialised yet. They are currently at $100M market cap remember - not a small amount and at this point it appears wildly ahead of what the company can deliver. 

That leaves the question of do you believe in the technology solutions that they have to offer. Not just “VR good” - what does VR1 specifically have to offer as far as products go? For me it’s a no. 

I also am extremely concerned about the company’s links to EM1. Same chairman and VR1 (through a subsidiary) does work for EM1. No bueno.</body>

   <body>Got out a month or 2 ago. Honestly, I've seen all this before - everything seems promising and revolutionary, deals with everyone, but deep down something is very wrong and the market knows it. Money never comes. Have a look at the XPE chart going back a few years, as that had a similar story (just it was IoT instead of VR). Deals with Intel etc getting announced every day, yet somehow never made a single cent.

Depending on how you draw the support line on a chart, VR1 broke support yesterday, or is a hair off doing so. If it trades at 10c, you'd want to be the fuck out ASAP as it's then going back to around 7.5c. Just look at the market depth and you'll see there's barely any orders in between 7.5 and 10c.

Also just on basic fundamentals, as the other poster mentioned it's already $100mil market cap, so how high could it even go? And when will substantial revenue come? Clearly not soon enough, so do you want to wait 6+ months even if you think it's a decent company when there are plenty of other rocket ships out there?</body>

   <body>Yep. Mostly? Regret. 

Haven't had time to completely dissect the half yearly report but a brief scan doesn't make me comfortable with my hopes in my investment at the moment..</body>

  <body>Keeping an eye on ANX, will come out of trading halt today in regards to a capital raise, depending on the raise details definitely has the potential to moon. Hoping for a drop to 6c to buy more.</body>

  <body>Two announcements today in the portfolio so far. LTR and PRL

Anyone good with gold announcements? Still trying to figure out the depth v g/t but it LTR’s announcement this morning any good overall?

4m @ 10.1 g/t is solid based off what I have read in the past

EDIT - LKE is in- tendies ahoy?</body>

    <body>I have bought a small package a bit ago around .09 what do you like so much about it? I get that data could be the future but are you on board with the HC blokes saying that its an imminent 30 bagger? Still waiting for that 2nd API before years end (2020) 

I still really like it and could see this being a top up time but seems like a lot of people could be taking advantage of their pro subscription and just waiting for the free trail to run out.

Would like to hear what you think.</body>
