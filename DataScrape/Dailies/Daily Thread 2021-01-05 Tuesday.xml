       <body>the thing is, people are allso waiting for profitabilty margins to be augmented further, they had a 138k profit for about 300mil company at the time. if it is &lt;1m again...i fear may be a huge drop off</body>
       <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="reptings" created="2021-01-06 21:58:52+10:00" sentiment="HYPE 8">
        <body>I’m not really fearful, if there is a overreaction from the market it gives me a grand opportunity to buy up more stocks of possibly my favourite company on the asx atm. I’m not phased and suspect a large amount of investors wouldn’t either about profitability due to the effectiveness of management who are continually meeting and exceeding there goals. They didn’t mention any goals to my recollection about chasing profit margins so I don’t suspect a great deal of growth to come from it.</body>

          <body>I am but I’m not aware of the current performance rights, I think all the ones at 30c are done. If they get more at 40c I’ll be happy because that means the sp had remained there for 30+ days.</body>

But nah, you must've been holding for 6-8 months tops? Even if you bought in April you'd have joined the multi-bag club instead of the jobseeker club.

       <body>That's not the sound of confidence. I'll entertain though, 15% would be a good little rise with the amount I have. 

u/username-taken82 another bet for me. Old mate from the previous one still hasn't paid up on the wicked wings for APT finishing above $100. Two wins on DOU bets, one for APT as well and now this. Can I get a "don't bet against this idiot" flair if it goes through?

DW8 on open was .044, close on 5th of Feb needs to be 15% on that. If it closes at .0505 (the nearest increment allowed) then I'm in the clear.

  <body>9SP - my order has filled. Ready for it to meme again. Am taking ban bets.


AV1 - huge year. Fkn excited for this as I know a bunch of you are on it so keen to celebrate with you mob.


ANP - making moves. Some decent sized orders went through at 14c.


IHL - lost some momentum but I'm calling 25c before March.


ESH - looks like bottom has been found at 1.5c/1.6c. Threatened a 1.7c close. My first time buying options tho, ESHOA at 0.006, with strike price of 0.02 so as long as it's above 2.6c by Oct 2022, we looking the goods.</body>

  <body>Long story short, value side (~30-35%) of my portfolio slid but growth side went up a little. Overall 0.55% green.

CCG went down 8%. This is nice because I can buy more. They have a PE of one. I'm not a PE guy but that's gotta be good. Even if bad news and/or downtrend for a while I'm happy to park money. Management have done well last few years &amp; they're a perfect business to benefit from hybrid offices.

TLT went down like 5%. It's up 54% this month still, surprised it's not more. Pretty happy with my position here so looking at other markets renewable companies now. Ideal would be something nice based in WA or QLD but the options are slim &amp; too small for me rn. Still trying to pick up more companies that aren't tiny.

Watching for tomorrow, CDA, APX, NXL, OEC.

Also good stuff 4DS &amp; WBT holders today.</body>

   <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="Bigjohnthug" created="2021-01-05 19:32:04+10:00">
    <body>TLT got a takeover offer from Infratil. Thus far Infratil have bought ~1% more &amp; the price is up ~70% since ann.

NEW- are you invested? Why? What do they do? 

From what I gathered; they took on a bunch of debt to buy small solar plants- eight are &lt;10mW &amp; only three are &gt;100mW-  of 16 operating who knows how many not. Sites  mostly stock photos with barely any substance. Often misleading info too.

Not bagging on them just honestly can't figure out the upside. They say NAV is $1.22 but I can't find their working.</body>

  <body>BUD out of trading halt. To sum up, $50 million in debt is now fully paid off with a $10 million debt forgiveness and $10 million from capital raising, the other $30 million coming from sales (not yet shown on reports). New debt financing facility of $20 million comes with shared issued to the financing company, if the financing company chooses to sell off the shares they must write down the debt on a dollar to dollar basis. They have also removed manufacturing limitations allowing them to expand in 2021 and reduce costs significantly. I reckon they hit $200 million revenue for FY2021/22. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</body>

   <body>I hold this. But can’t believe I’m ripping on a stock I hold I believe it will fall again a bit further down to 5”s. There’s still tons of options to come for further dilution. There’s also a large amount of bag holders sitting in that candle.

On the plus side the hype has gone. It is a real beginning to a discovery whether it’s economic or not will be up to this years campaign. I also believe a CR will be on the cards due to my theory on further depreciation of SP and options not being able to be converted for cash flow.</body>

     <body>Sorry to hear mate. No matter what there will be time to average down. Based solely on the HC dickheads there very impatient and don’t understand shit about the complexities of monetising a nickel/copper resource or if it has economic value. 

I have a feeling those who are holding options such as brokers are driving up the SP to convert and dump as it’s what has been happening for a while now. So this should bring the Sp down for awhile. In the interim trend traders will set up for announcements and sell on release. Could I maybe suggest on this one instead of averaging down go with something less riskier</body>

  <body>PKS broke out yesterday. Having some pullback today because all attention is on commodity price. It's a good window of opportunity to make and entry today I reckon. 

Low mkt cap. Profitable business. Quite a number of contracts signing last year. I expect more this year. Medical decision making software. With current medical emergency we are facing today, this will be "Right time, Right place" type of stock. 

All just my opinions.</body>

  <body>AGY - The RSI was 92 at yesterday's close. Went up 50% on no news and huge vol. I haven't looked on HC or Twitter but I would say one of those will be the catalyst. How does it go up 50% on no news without being pumped somewhere?</body>

   <body>Someone worth occasionally listening to on HC is W3hunter that dudes been calling this one since back in December. Really good charts and answers any questions you might have.</body>

  <body>Cxo went well today. Now for another lithium stock that is barely getting any recognition in this sub EMH. 4th largest hard rock lithium resource with the czech government being involved and funding part of it.

Cheers for downvotes</body>

   <body>Good entry price. It might be going thru a breakout today. If so, you would get a better price tomorrow. Sell half? If I held it, I'd hold another day - If it can get above 32c then 35c would be likely. You do you.</body>

  <body>Another day, another all time high in TSLA. Even when the market is down 2%+ LMAO, love it.

I do expect at least low 600's before the Q4 result at the end of Janaury though (which should be a big beat, probs see 800+ on that), just due some profit taking/taking a bit of the froth off. Should give the chance for atayls to get out of his short, maybe even break even!

Edited for clarity, I'm still ballsdeep long lol.</body>

  <body>First trades of 2021 done. Got out of Qantas and reinvested all of my profits into FMG. Going to be a long term hold with this one so im okay with buying in at ATH. Ill cost average every month.

Diversified and bought some ETFs as well. VDBA seemed like a fairly safe choice. 

Going to meme into 88E I think on payday though.

Guys pls im only buying 88E cos its cheap and that means it can send me to moon easier right?</body>
