   <body>Anyone have any thoughts on ACF?</body>
   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="ggidd" created="2021-01-10 22:45:07+10:00" sentiment="TIP 5">
    <body>Its a bit of a slow burner. Good income stock with a good dividend yield and stable SP. I like that they have a DRP letting you compound your dividends over the years... They succesfully pivotted the core business from residential/commercial housing focus to more industrial/engineering projects. Shows the management has plans and knows how to implement them. They are winning new contracts and if you have a look at their recent annual report sales and earnings are respectably growing yoy. At 82M market cap it has room to grow. Its one Im comfortable holding, doesnt cause any stress but its not exactly rocketed whilst Ive held it for a few months. Anyway let me know if you find anything interesting about ACF.</body>
    <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="ImHiFunctioning" created="2021-01-11 07:02:18+10:00">
     <body>Yeah I bought some a little while ago because I'm bullish on government spending to boost the economy in the form of infrastructure and like you said, ACF are moving into civil contracts and away from resi. They have a good cash balance and are working on cost cutting. Only thing is the SP doesn't do anything most days and I'm wondering if that's due to low liquidity. Will hold though and wait for next earnings report.</body>

   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="timbuckley66" created="2021-01-11 15:38:58+10:00" sentiment="TIP 5">
    <body>MCP - something happened in Oct and the share price shit the bed. It has been consolidating for 2 months after hitting $1.13 low. Could break upwards and test $2 but also could remain sideways or break down depending on what caused the initial sell off in Oct and whether those issues are getting addressed or not. Have a look at a 2 year weekly chart - makes it easy to see the trends. Rock solid resistance at $1.45 - If it closes above that - good entry point.</body>

     <body>IBX is a company that is going to change how cancer is detected in patients! It’s a non invasive approach which uses nano particles which are magnetic to determine early stages of cancer! These nano particles specifically attach to cancer cells and thats how they become identifiable. Traditional methods of cancer detection are sometimes hard to determine whether it is benign tumours or true cancers, and usually because of this, a biopsy is needed! Theres more to it, definitely recommend checking their website out! Im very confident in this company, their technology in my eyes is ground breaking, and cheap! Ofcourse as always DYOR</body>

      <body>Successful human trials will really rocket the price. It's too risky for me right now because I don't like to invest in biotech/pharma until after trials prove effectiveness. So far IBX have had success in animal trials, but positive results in people will be a huge de-risking for a lot of potential investors just keeping an eye on IBX.</body>

   <body>The trick is to spend the weekend/nights/market closing periods to do some scans of movers, check the charts, find the best 2 or 3 and act on the next market day on those stocks - pre market auction usually confirms which one to trade - and don't get distracted by VUL. Rinse and repeat until they put you in a box. There is always something set up for a move.</body>

  <body>ANP - every time I blink I see this ticker. Been thinking about Monday all weekend. Closed on a 20c high on a friday arvo. Huge missed t2 opportunity. Calling a 50c close, based on nothing more than gut feel and wishful thinking. I'll settle for 30c tho.


IHL &amp; AV1 - one of these will give me a 20% day some time this week. Feelin' it.


9SP - when you get in early on a stock, at ground level, you gotta play the waiting game. Rarely will you buy a 10 bagger the same month it 10 bags.


ESH - as above</body>

    <body>Cos the guy who got the guy who got me on AV1, on AV1, said to think of 9SP as your new AV1.


There. That should clear things up.


Also, both guys have made buckets. So when they say buy, I say how much. No complaints yet as I got av1 at 11c (averaged up heaps since then with latest parcel at its current price of 20.5c) and also ANP at 10c, currently 20c.</body>

    <body>IBX is a company that is going to change how cancer is detected in patients! It’s a non invasive approach which uses nano particles which are magnetic to determine early stages of cancer! These nano particles specifically attach to cancer cells and thats how they become identifiable. Traditional methods of cancer detection are sometimes hard to determine whether it is benign tumours or true cancers, and usually because of this, a biopsy is needed! Theres more to it, definitely recommend checking their website out! Im very confident in this company, their technology in my eyes is ground breaking, and cheap! Ofcourse as always DYOR</body>

     <body>Successful human trials will really rocket the price. It's too risky for me right now because I don't like to invest in biotech/pharma until after trials prove effectiveness. So far IBX have had success in animal trials, but positive results in people will be a huge de-risking for a lot of potential investors just keeping an eye on IBX.</body>

       <body>Man, the stress of t+2 plays is so far from worth it to me. You've got one day, and in my eyes if you want to make it worthwhile you have to leverage almost the equivalent of your portfolio, the downside being if there's a downturn or halt you have to scramble to cover the play, selling other things you didn't want to exit from, with the potential upside being one day worth of rocket. So many steps backwards if it goes wrong and only a small step forward if it goes right</body>

   <body>It's a coal burning energy company.  Their own projections have their profits declining year on year under every single climate action scenario + ethical superfunds have divested.  Also their dividends are 0% franked in 2021 and 2022 before returning to being majority or fully franked in 2023, so they're not as juicy as they look if you care about that.

It's a dividend play, but paying those dividends will also drop the stock value and decline year on year.  Your call, but i think getting out of gas production in 2016 after poisoning a river was poorly timed given the current LNG gas price run up.</body>

    <body>Most comprehensive is the [investor Preso here](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02317848-6A1010750?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4).


A few quick notes:

* They're cashed up with $15M on hand to get things done, per their most recent quarterly. 

* The mine is a simple process, resulting in high-grade iron, and will start production Q2 21. There are neighbouring steel mills that are likely to become a customer, meaning they sell right out of their front door, cutting costs etc.

* SOI - 1.8B, however 1.1B are in escrow for 24 months. Significant holders hold just more than 58% SOI, and are in it for the long haul.

* Prelim numbers suggest the mine will produce $100M worth of iron per annum, after costs. Current market cap is approx $120M, which is ludicrously low.

* SP is likely low at this stage due to pending final drilling results and approvals, but based on the (ahem) irons in the fire this is full steam ahead, unlikely to see any big surprises here. An existing feasibility report has been approved as of Dec 2020, which seems to have resulted in an almost doubling of the SP. Will be exciting to see what final drilling and approvals to for the SP over the coming few months, and beyond.

Basically, I am but a lowly mechanical/project engineer, but the simple process and project are immediately understandable to me, and it really looks like they're doing absolutely everything right. Coupled with the run on iron prices recently, which I am extremely bullish on given the state of the world rn, I'm excited to see what happens long term.</body>

   <body>Could be. The chance of the MORE act passing the senate and effectively decriminalising weed federally has increased a shit tonne since the senate runoff elections. Basically the Dems control the house and the senate now so weed is a good chance to be no worse than alcohol soon.  


On top of this, if the US does it, most of the western world is likely to soon follow because they will likely not have the tenacity to continue policing a ban on the drug without US support on the international front.</body>

   <body>Its a bit of a slow burner. Good income stock with a good dividend yield and stable SP. I like that they have a DRP letting you compound your dividends over the years... They succesfully pivotted the core business from residential/commercial housing focus to more industrial/engineering projects. Shows the management has plans and knows how to implement them. They are winning new contracts and if you have a look at their recent annual report sales and earnings are respectably growing yoy. At 82M market cap it has room to grow. Its one Im comfortable holding, doesnt cause any stress but its not exactly rocketed whilst Ive held it for a few months. Anyway let me know if you find anything interesting about ACF.</body>
   <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="ImHiFunctioning" created="2021-01-11 07:02:18+10:00">
    <body>Yeah I bought some a little while ago because I'm bullish on government spending to boost the economy in the form of infrastructure and like you said, ACF are moving into civil contracts and away from resi. They have a good cash balance and are working on cost cutting. Only thing is the SP doesn't do anything most days and I'm wondering if that's due to low liquidity. Will hold though and wait for next earnings report.</body>

   <body>USD has crashed over a year and POG hasn't done that debasement any justice. It is getting more and more accepted that big banks manipulate POG all day every day via comex paper. What hope is there? Even great gold producers that are cash machines get belted by the gold price. I think market participants are getting tired of the endless manipulation. As always, there will be a bottom and a bounce but there is easier money elsewhere for now. At least for me.</body>

      <body>Ahh Yup. I found where it said it on the website and it says more specifically that you can't make more than three DAY trades within a 5 day period.

So basically, if you make any trade, you hold it overnight and it's not considered a day trade.

I also have more than 25k USD in the account so I guess I'm not affected by it anyways. Still new to investing</body>
      <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="lululemonhead" created="2021-01-11 15:12:44+10:00">
       <body>Holding overnight is not a loophole lmao, but I like your literal interpretation. If you make more than 3 trades in a 5 day period with an account &lt;25K USD on day of close you will get your account barred for 90 days. 

Or are you gonna tell us what a NIGHT trade is lol?</body>

   <body>MCP - something happened in Oct and the share price shit the bed. It has been consolidating for 2 months after hitting $1.13 low. Could break upwards and test $2 but also could remain sideways or break down depending on what caused the initial sell off in Oct and whether those issues are getting addressed or not. Have a look at a 2 year weekly chart - makes it easy to see the trends. Rock solid resistance at $1.45 - If it closes above that - good entry point.</body>
