    <body>Because there are things like trend lines. For AVA apart from a quick blimp this is currently down

Because shareholders are seeing us multibag on various lithium, uranium and other areas whilst seeing a slow 3%ish percent bleed and thinking that the money can be invested elsewhere for now. And they can get back in at discount if they decide to go back

There are things like sentiment. AVA is not alone. Stocks like WSR have been reporting amazing growth as well and have not moved in share price. (Better than down I guess) 

You can keep accumulating and insulting people on here and we rookies will just keep on reeping our triple digit gains

To give you an example, I sold out of my other stocks to board LRS SLX BPH and IXR a while ago with trailing stop-losses - even though the investments that the money was in was doing fine. If I was holding AVA it would have been the first on the chopping block 

Happy averaging down</body>

     <body>I haven't insulted people, but the same rookies who make triple digit gains on speculative stocks are the same ones to lose over 50% on other investments - they just don't talk about it because it doesn't sound as good.

When we finally end this crazy bull run, very few of these speculative stocks will be worth even a quarter what they are now. Everyone is a winner in bull markets until they aren't - most (especially people here) will sell their stocks for a loss only to buy back in once the market comes back up.</body>
     <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="nikoel" created="2021-01-19 22:56:44+10:00">
      <body>Well everyone is winning, but you

Using your logic. If you can’t make money in this crazy bull run then what are the chances of you making money when this stops

If you don’t think you’ve insulted people on here, there is truly no hope for you</body>
      <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="AnonAnalyst" created="2021-01-19 23:18:37+10:00" sentiment="TIP 15">
       <body>"Everyone is winning but you"

How much of a salty cunt do you need to be to type that? I have no doubt that I'll make better returns than you over the long term, it's not even close. Keep on gambling on speculative stocks and having no clue about how investment actually works, I hope you keep the same ego once you've lost a sizeable portion of your money.

Sure I've insulted people here but not for a while, I actually haven't been on Reddit much. I could care less when this sub - and most of Reddit for that matter - has a mob mentality whereby the unpopular opinions get downvoted. I get upvoted when my stocks go up and shit on when they go down because people like you only see share price, not the underlying value of stocks.  

I've never said that I've made no money from the bull run as you've implied; a stock dipping short term when the underlying asset's value is going up is an opportunity, which is why I have bought and will continue to buy the dip. You will probably never understand how to measure a companies true worth and in the long run you're not going to be any better than the average investor (if that).</body>

   <body>For better or worse I am out of VUL... 28 bags i think. 

Mixed emotions cause I left a good 4000 on the table but i should be happy with what i made. 

Buying myself a new laptop as a congrats and i am going to sink the rest back into the market. 

Lots of people have been asking me to check out stocks or look at stocks and I wish i had the time I really do. But i have a 3 year old and work and I can only give them a cursory glance at best.  

ANP new highs, EMN lost me about the same as I made on ANP.

SBW may have found bottom i dont know. 

RLT little pump is over, bots back in control. Will probably see close to $1 again if it has its way. 

AV1 below my average price... time to top up or run screaming for the hills?</body>

 It would have to drop dramatically for me to consider it. They are still a great company but now a bit overvalued in my opinion. Who knows, 2 years later they may be worth 50$ a share and I would have pissed away  40k by selling. But that seems a bit far fetched.

     <body>Yeah wtf was going on there. When I saw it hit 14 my first thought was it was only going one way but didn’t think it would come down as far as it did. 

Either way, you managed to do what people only dream of.</body>

      <body>Yeah,  i hope this wasn't a once in a lifetime opportunity. So many things i could have done better. 

If you did a 10k yolo on it every day this year you would have made more then i made holding since June.</body>

       <body>I think that’s in hindsight but trading in hindsight is an absolute bitch. I really don’t think anyone could’ve held as long as you did and definitely don’t imagine anyone (who likes money) yolo’ing each day into a stock that has run as hard as it has.</body>

    <body>Entirely possible. But i think i've fucked my CGT wait time now.
 It would have to drop dramatically for me to consider it. They are still a great company but now a bit overvalued in my opinion. Who knows, 2 years later they may be worth 50$ a share and I would have pissed away  40k by selling. But that seems a bit far fetched. 

The 1st red day they have will be a bloodbath i think.</body>

  <body>ANP - ok quick ELI5 DD before it takes off. Sarepta was developing a drug for Duchenne's Musculuar Dystrophy. Some big ass pharma (I think roche) paid them I think over $1B for something or other (fuck my memory is bad). Anyway, point is, ANP's drug was shaping up to blow Sarepta's out of the water. So if ANP simply matched Sapretas MC when I first bought in at 10c, it would mean 50 bags. Obviously a long road ahead to get to 50 bags but even a third of that would have been fine and dandy. Ok so the reason the SP went from 10c to between 13c and 15c was because of Wilsons broker report valuing it between 50c to over $1. And then a couple weeks later a double whammy happened. First, another broker report from Morgan's came out valuing it I think 40 something cents. But the big news was that Sarepta fucked up and everyone bailed and money is pouring into ANP now. So ANP now sits at 25c as of close today. Holders are either hoping Sarepta or Pfizer buys out ANP in a few weeks to put us over $1 at least. Or, some of them prefer someone partners with us and takes us to $5.

That's the gist. If I'm off in some areas, someone please correct me. But that's the eli5 version.


AV1 - got my order at 17.5c. Chill guys. This is going places.


9sP - an exercise in patience.


ESH - seems to have turned the corner.


IHL - guess next week is the week. But it's coming.


Also, did we crack over 1000 comments in yesterday's daily?</body>

LKE - The hook up with Lilac and NVX was enough for me to have a play.

EMN - Bought some at close. Probs buy more tomorrow if it keeps dropping. Project sounds awesome. Green and fairly easy to get the Mn.

IHL - I like hallucinogenics. I like the idea of them being legal even better. 

UWL- Hit an ATH today. If it can over $2 this week I might clear house. Though they have a great management team and the Telstra stuff is just the start. Wouldn't personally take my NBN too them, cos I'm a cheap kent.</body>

  <body>PFT 🐟 NEWS 

Anyone who had concerns over PFT revenue from the last announcement, PFT posted on Twitter today an article that was run over the weekend and in it, Cooper states that the Monde Nissin Australia deal for Woodbridge will "add 15% to the total PFT business." Therefore, anyone interpreting the last announcement thinking that ALL the businesses would increase PFT revenue by a "minimum of 15%" were wrong. Woodbridge ALONE is adding 15% to the total PFT business from the MNA deal.  😍

EMN - On sale after todays profit taking and will continue climbing to new heights. Uniquely positioned in the lithium battery space.

SYA - A lot of profit taking today but this stock will hit 10c within the new couple of weeks. Their new partnership with PLL means they are directly tied in with TESLA 🚀

LKE - You guys know the vibe already 🚀

LPD - Not many people are speaking about this stock. Uniquely positioned in the lithium exploration and production space. 🚀

   <body>Because there are things like trend lines. For AVA apart from a quick blimp this is currently down

Because shareholders are seeing us multibag on various lithium, uranium and other areas whilst seeing a slow 3%ish percent bleed and thinking that the money can be invested elsewhere for now. And they can get back in at discount if they decide to go back

There are things like sentiment. AVA is not alone. Stocks like WSR have been reporting amazing growth as well and have not moved in share price. (Better than down I guess) 

You can keep accumulating and insulting people on here and we rookies will just keep on reeping our triple digit gains

To give you an example, I sold out of my other stocks to board LRS SLX BPH and IXR a while ago with trailing stop-losses - even though the investments that the money was in was doing fine. If I was holding AVA it would have been the first on the chopping block 

Happy averaging down</body>
   <comment ups="7" downs="0" author="AnonAnalyst" created="2021-01-19 22:05:09+10:00">
    <body>I haven't insulted people, but the same rookies who make triple digit gains on speculative stocks are the same ones to lose over 50% on other investments - they just don't talk about it because it doesn't sound as good.

When we finally end this crazy bull run, very few of these speculative stocks will be worth even a quarter what they are now. Everyone is a winner in bull markets until they aren't - most (especially people here) will sell their stocks for a loss only to buy back in once the market comes back up.</body>
    <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="nikoel" created="2021-01-19 22:56:44+10:00">
     <body>Well everyone is winning, but you

Using your logic. If you can’t make money in this crazy bull run then what are the chances of you making money when this stops

If you don’t think you’ve insulted people on here, there is truly no hope for you</body>
     <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="AnonAnalyst" created="2021-01-19 23:18:37+10:00">
      <body>"Everyone is winning but you"

How much of a salty cunt do you need to be to type that? I have no doubt that I'll make better returns than you over the long term, it's not even close. Keep on gambling on speculative stocks and having no clue about how investment actually works, I hope you keep the same ego once you've lost a sizeable portion of your money.

Sure I've insulted people here but not for a while, I actually haven't been on Reddit much. I could care less when this sub - and most of Reddit for that matter - has a mob mentality whereby the unpopular opinions get downvoted. I get upvoted when my stocks go up and shit on when they go down because people like you only see share price, not the underlying value of stocks.  

I've never said that I've made no money from the bull run as you've implied; a stock dipping short term when the underlying asset's value is going up is an opportunity, which is why I have bought and will continue to buy the dip. You will probably never understand how to measure a companies true worth and in the long run you're not going to be any better than the average investor (if that).</body>

EDIT: okay the nickel miner I bought for their nickel project, sold off their nickel project</body>

Bought into CROO at 0.041 and the madlad closed at 0.046, if CRO keeps going i'm gonna coom

  <body>Hi, after lurking here for about 6 months or so I still can't quite figure this out... is this about right?

paper hands  = holding a paper loss

diamond hands = holding a position in profit

thank you</body>

   <body>Paper hands = someone who is a weak bitch and panic sells at the tiniest sight of a loss or down trend

Diamond hands = big balls holding through down/red periods due to faith that the company will go up long term

note that both can end up fucking themselves either way</body>

   <body>The term paper hands refers to a person who at the first sight of a downturn panic sells. The idea is their hands are made of paper so they literally can't hold the stocks.

Diamond hands is the opposite. Your hands are unbreakable so you will never sell the stock until it goes bankrupt and delisted. Down with the titanic.</body>
