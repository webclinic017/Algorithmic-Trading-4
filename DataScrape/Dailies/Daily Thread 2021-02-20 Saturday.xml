   <body>Is z1p expected to go up on the 25th after their announcement? Would buying zip below $14 be worth it before the 25th? Ofc all just thoughts no one really knows</body>

    <body>Who knows... But their quarterly results were great. So it's reasonably safe to assume their half yearly will be good. Plus the anticipation of US investors/listings is promising.</body>

      <body>Again, who knows, but I wouldn't bet on it. Watch it Monday and see what it does. I suspect the drop on Thursday and Friday was down to a level of consolidation and support.</body>

      <body>I put an order to in on Sunday night at 12.xx. Within the first hour of market open on Monday it went up to 14.xx, I ended up getting in at 13.90 and it‚Äôs since dropped and slowly climbed again over the week but I‚Äôm still in the red. I‚Äôm anticipating it to do the same thing this coming week. If you haven‚Äôt DYOR on it yet, it‚Äôs a fairly volatile stock, seems to go down on good announcements but overall I like it and in my opinion it‚Äôs a better company than Afterpay. I‚Äôll be holding longterm. 

Not a financial adviser, DYOR &amp; DD etc.</body>

    <body>Pick up any news paper from the weekend and read about retail spending - if Z1p and APT don‚Äôt absolutely cream this report then I‚Äôll be shocked. 

It‚Äôs about HOW well they cream it - I think they will knock it out of the park and will spend a few sessions re rating to $20.</body>

    <body>The stock tripled in price over the last few weeks.

Heck it was trading at like $3 last time it put out it‚Äôs first half yearly report (for FY2020). It showed it had increased its loss from -$8m in 2018 to like -$30m in 2019.

In all likelihood it‚Äôs report will show that despite the amazing ‚Äúcustomer growf‚Äù they flog in their trading updates every chance they get it has probably recorded and even larger loss this year than last year.

Like go read their actual cash flow and profit statements buried on page 70 of their annual report. They lose money on every transaction because the cost of sales/operations/financing/bad debts are higher than the revenue they take in from operations.

Share price that tripled in 3 months on negative profit growth. How do you think the market will react when it comes out?</body>

    <body>Nope, you‚Äôre not alone.

 I‚Äôm gonna wait  for a pump then offload most of my XST shares, but only because after the last week I‚Äôve learned the high risk, high reward play is not my style.

I‚Äôve done even more DD after the shit storm that was this week, and still think there‚Äôs still potential for 2-3 bagger in the short term. So I will probably keep 1/3 of my shares.

The downrampers are not entirely wrong with their analysis but they are also exaggerating a lot of it, just as the pumpers are. (Downrampers love to use worst-case scenario figures and pumpers love to use best-case figures, to prove their respective points). I like to do my own DD and not listen to either of these parties.

The good thing about this situation is we won‚Äôt have to wait long to figure out whether to continue holding, or cut our losses. Spud announcement is imminent and drilling will only take about a month.</body>

    <body>I've put in a sell order 1 pip higher than my buy in, if drilling results are miraculously good then I'm in the queue comparatively early to at least get out adequately on hype wave 2.  

If results suck then I'll sell at market to recover (hopefully) half my capital to use it elsewhere and if there's any balance I'll leave it in for a few years until the next hype for the next well somewhere, and sell them.</body>

    <body>Not much growth in ad spending in 2020 even a decline in some sectors / countries.

30/10-2020 over 50 paying customers (25% increase)

27/01-2021 over 100 paying customers (83% increase over September 2020 numbers)

They expect to convert a bunch of free users to paying users in March 2021.

Some ramblings about big international names.

The competition certainly has adds out on the keyword Trafficguard to try and redirect users away from Adveritas, maybe they are on to something about the quality of the product.

revenue up 9% to 263k, pretty good when US ad spending hardly grew and Australian spending is down.  If you look at RnD and Marketing/sales as an investment in the future and not an expense it looks good too I think.

It's still on my list of ASX\_bets stocks to watch maybe buy, even after the whole pickle thing.

With all that said you might want to sell because I suck at picking rockets

   <body>Crystal ball for next week - 
* DW8 options expire on Tuesday and I'm expecting to test 6 cents during the week
* LKE might get some early battery testing results, regardless it'll test .4 and break through
* NVX will probably retrace until more details around the microgrid partnership battery revenue is announced
* I expect SWF to rebound a little on Monday, finishing green
* APT will test 160 for absolutely no reason
* IOU to hover around .50 when the new shares hit the market
* ASIA to have a bigger percentage gain next week than FANG

If absolutely none of the above happens, I'll take a weeks ban. u/username-taken82 I'm back for more pain.

  <body>Crystal ball for next week - 
* DW8 options expire on Tuesday and I'm expecting to test 6 cents during the week
* LKE might get some early battery testing results, regardless it'll test .4 and break through
* NVX will probably retrace until more details around the microgrid partnership battery revenue is announced
* I expect SWF to rebound a little on Monday, finishing green
* APT will test 160 for absolutely no reason
* IOU to hover around .50 when the new shares hit the market
* ASIA to have a bigger percentage gain next week than FANG

If absolutely none of the above happens, I'll take a weeks ban. u/username-taken82 I'm back for more pain.

  <body>Ok peeps, 3100 pushups, pull ups and sit ups. You guys are absolute freaks but I'll do it. 

I was only expecting maybe 50 likes, which is still a fuck ton, but hey ho. 

Obviously I can't do all of those in one day, so I offer two options. 

1 : I do it all, but over the course of multiple days 

2 : I spend 1 WHOLE day doing it, seeing how much I can get though over the course of 24 hours. I think I could probably get a lot done, or end up hospitalized. Either way.

Completely up to you guys, most upvoted response to this comment will be the option I do. 

Otherwise, keeping buying the LKE dip and enjoy the weekend!

*Edit*

Have gone with option 2. Will be doing that on Tuesday me thinks, expect record high LKE movement on that day!

Just found out the fucking world record for pull-ups in a day is 7000 LOL ok I'm doing that last. 

3000 pushups will suck, but I think I can do it. 

3000 sit ups is probably harder then the pushups. So I'll do that second.</body>

   <body>A WHOLE 24 hours of doing as many push ups, sit ups and pull ups as possible will completely fuck you up. You'll be fucking broken. 

I vote for that.

Edit: my comment is getting upvoted but I don't want you to do this because I think you'll hurt yourself. This edit will probably mean more upvotes.</body>

Nah man, unless you've been doing them for a while you aren't knocking them out in one day.

   <body>Nope, you‚Äôre not alone.

 I‚Äôm gonna wait  for a pump then offload most of my XST shares, but only because after the last week I‚Äôve learned the high risk, high reward play is not my style.

I‚Äôve done even more DD after the shit storm that was this week, and still think there‚Äôs still potential for 2-3 bagger in the short term. So I will probably keep 1/3 of my shares.

The downrampers are not entirely wrong with their analysis but they are also exaggerating a lot of it, just as the pumpers are. (Downrampers love to use worst-case scenario figures and pumpers love to use best-case figures, to prove their respective points). I like to do my own DD and not listen to either of these parties.

The good thing about this situation is we won‚Äôt have to wait long to figure out whether to continue holding, or cut our losses. Spud announcement is imminent and drilling will only take about a month.</body>

  <body>What a week !  Now some of these gains were handed back - but all are still multi bags up in the same week

BD1 600% in a week (on news)

FFG 575% in a week (on news )

PRL 470% in a day (on news)

And to finish AQS 1900% in a week - on \*zero\* news - nothing, zilch, zippo, nada  


&lt;Edit&gt; for the record - my share of those golden runs.....I squeezed out a tiny T+2 25% on PRL - all the others just flew by my nose</body>

  <body>Dumped all my cash into EGR.

- Has had support from the Australian government 

- CR just completed at 60c 

- Has listed on the German stock exchange and plans to list in the US soon

- Their recycling process recovers graphite anode material for re-use in lithium-ion batteries for EVs with a 99.95 per cent carbon purity¬†(worlds first non toxic patent pending process)

- Plans to use those funds raised for the construction of the world's first (outside of China) battery anode material purification facility in Western Australia. 

- That facility will use the "EcoGraf purification technology" (the elimination of the use of toxic hydrofluoric acid (HF)) to provide quality battery anode material products to lithium-ion battery and anode manufacturers.

- ASX-listed GR Engineering Services (GNG) to engineer the new battery graphite facility 

- The new facility will be capable of producing 20,000 tonnes per annum¬†

- As companies around the world are trying to stop relying on China , and also be "green" / eco friendly , this puts EGR in a very good position for global clients and electric vehicle manufacturers 

- Recent forecasts have indicated that the battery graphite market is expected to grow by over 30 per cent per year over the next decade as the world moves to electric vehicles and clean, renewable energy.

- European Union tightens regulatory environment for battery recycling - EGR passes the new EU regulations

- GM has pledged to end production of carbon emitting vehicles by 2035

- President Joe Biden has pledged to boost sales of EVs, including purchases by the US government.

In the media:

In addition to its recycling project, EcoGraf is building a state-of-the-art facility in WA to manufacture spherical graphite products for export markets in Asia, America and Europe.

EcoGraf is developing its TanzGraphite natural flake graphite business in Tanzania for which sales agreements have been negotiated with Germany‚Äôs ThyssenKrupp and Japan‚Äôs Sojitz.

The Epanko graphite project is located 370km west of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and has a production capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year over an 18-year mine life.</body>

   <body>Very strange SP movement, it pumped to over a dollar after the cap raise then dumped relentlessly since - and finally given up on Friday. Held up decently on the German market overnight (10% drop), not sure if ASX will match up this week.</body>
   <comment ups="7" downs="0" author="SugeKnight_StandOver" created="2021-02-20 15:53:38+10:00">
    <body>The shares from the CR were only issued on Friday. 

So from the announcement (12th Feb) until Friday (19th Feb), some people were selling with the intention of "sell now and buy back in at a cheaper price". 

Some people done that,  some didn't as they didn't believe the price would go down and didn't want to miss out / lose their shares. (Aka diamond hands)

EGR was shorted approx 600k with the expectation of the SP drop upon issue of shares. 

On Friday the shares were issued and you would of had some sophs flipping the shares , and retail holders panic selling. 

There was however VERY strong buying / accumulation  happening at the same time.

The prediction was that the SP would drop to between 60-70c once the shares are issued (this is only temporary though). You can see for example when WBT had a CR , same kind of deal. 

The shorters will close their positions soon and EGR will be back in the green. I dont think its going any lower from here</body>

     <body>As someone who has made a couple of bags on EGR, my big concern was the lack of any real 'cornerstone investor' despite Andrew Sprinks stating so, FS and Mitishubishi just upped their holdings. My other concern is whether or not there will be much demand for recycled graphite in Perth. Are they going to ship from recycling factories in Europe and America to Perth to be recycled? 

I get that a Europe based factory is on the cards, but I believe that the CEO (Andrew Sprinks) is being vague.

\-Still hold EGR.</body>

    <body>Yeah, it was weird that it pumped after the CR. I was ready to sell before the freeze at open of $1.20. And then I got $1.05 at open after the hold. But it actually went above that the day after. I thought it would drop straight away. I guess the old saying any news is good news and it brought extra attention for a bit. I was thinking it would hold around $0.70 and I think it would have if the market didn‚Äôt turn on Friday as well. Now it could go lower but I‚Äôm expecting a bounce on Monday. I might leave it settle for a bit before looking of getting back in but I‚Äôll be watching close Monday.</body>

  <body>OTC NVX NVNXF held up nicely overnight at $3.37AUD equivalent. Motley Fool put out a pump article Friday, as did the Market Herald and Yahoo. There was also a presentation Friday arvo with the NVX CEO presenting as a part of the ShareCafe webinar with talks about their graphite plays on 2021. Even the boys at HC been doing some digging and finding links with NVX to the US DoD. US markets relatively flat with VIX down 2%, so moderately confident my NVX T+2 should work out.</body>

  <body>VMT - electric motorbikes, dollars are in the B2B market (think delivery scooters and hire bikes), increasing consumer sales to cashed up Asian and Indian kiddies - recent partnership with Ducati makes them look cooler particularly in those markets. They keep posting consistent quarterly results, sales increasing at a sustainable pace, hitting forecasts and projections. No crazy rockets, just seemingly good management and product. Releasing three new models on the 23rd, expecting a nice SP jump. I‚Äôm going to sell the news, wait for it to drift lower, and get back in before the next quarterly is released. Rinse and repeat until it stops working.</body>

   <body>I‚Äôm heavily invested in VMT and have been for a while. Consistent growth, profitable, in EV space and have just landed a massive B2B order. It‚Äôs weird how companies like that have a smaller market cap than these speculative BNPL companies. Guess it‚Äôs a competitive area. Good bet I reckon.

   <body>Not much growth in ad spending in 2020 even a decline in some sectors / countries.

30/10-2020 over 50 paying customers (25% increase)

27/01-2021 over 100 paying customers (83% increase over September 2020 numbers)

They expect to convert a bunch of free users to paying users in March 2021.

Some ramblings about big international names.

The competition certainly has adds out on the keyword Trafficguard to try and redirect users away from Adveritas, maybe they are on to something about the quality of the product.

revenue up 9% to 263k, pretty good when US ad spending hardly grew and Australian spending is down.  If you look at RnD and Marketing/sales as an investment in the future and not an expense it looks good too I think.

It's still on my list of ASX\_bets stocks to watch maybe buy, even after the whole pickle thing.

With all that said you might want to sell because I suck at picking rockets

       <body>Taking a slightly different angle, I love the concept of what they‚Äôre doing.

Key points:

Run by founders (with significant skin in game)

Low MC / low SOI / tightly held / cash on hand to cover to end of year

Significant cornerstone investor (Songtradr)

Clear plan (watch the webinars)

First to market (with certified data - there are crowd sourced alternatives)

Significant moats (years to secure data deals - some exclusive - time to ingest)

6 key business elements (data apis / music rights cut / subscriptions / muso social media platform / site ecommerce / using database and algorithms for other uses)

Songtradr API live March/April

Subscriptions restart April

Nightlife API live April

37mil individual recordings uploaded with all related metadata (Spotify has 50mil tracks) meaning Jaxsta ALREADY has critical mass to be able to provide a meaningful dataset to combine with ANY of the digital music providers in the world.

Increasingly, decisions are being assisted by AI/bots/algorithms. To be effective they require clean, certified data. In the music world, Jaxsta is the only supplier currently.  Per the webinars they‚Äôre talking businesses that NEED this data. 

Pricing / Profits / Risk - No holes to dig. No major capex incoming. No geopolitical risk. Pricing set by market standards. Data suppliers get 55% of API revenue so ‚Äòskin in the game‚Äô to help Jaxsta succeed.</body>

I‚Äôm anticipating it to do the same thing this coming week. If you haven‚Äôt DYOR on it yet, it‚Äôs a fairly volatile stock, seems to go down on good announcements but overall I like it and in my opinion it‚Äôs a better company than Afterpay.

   <body>The stock tripled in price over the last few weeks.

Heck it was trading at like $3 last time it put out it‚Äôs first half yearly report (for FY2020). It showed it had increased its loss from -$8m in 2018 to like -$30m in 2019.

In all likelihood it‚Äôs report will show that despite the amazing ‚Äúcustomer growf‚Äù they flog in their trading updates every chance they get it has probably recorded and even larger loss this year than last year.

Like go read their actual cash flow and profit statements buried on page 70 of their annual report. They lose money on every transaction because the cost of sales/operations/financing/bad debts are higher than the revenue they take in from operations.

Share price that tripled in 3 months on negative profit growth. How do you think the market will react when it comes out?</body>

     <body>Yeah definitely there's 3 blocks to go along with the expanded survey area for the East block. Options expire 31st October with 10c strike; I dont see PUR being under 10c by end of October unless it has found nothing significant and if that's the case then it would be close to zero cents anyway. So it's either gonna be above 10c/80M mc, or near worthless, making the options a good punt for a small parcel imo. Can always dump them off for big gains if it rockets again on pre drill hype. Pretty disappointed i didn't free carry today at 6c because I was greedy &amp; thought it could hit 7c and then it tanked hard but whatever, good day anyway.</body>

       <body>There is a few reason why PUR can‚Äôt do a CHN. Mainly it‚Äôs related to SOI whose holding and whose interested. CHN at its lowest was probably about a 13cent share just for some context. 

Not saying it can‚Äôt hit 10cents but it‚Äôs certainly not one id pick to make a 1.5 billion dollar market cap.</body>

  <body>Does anyone here use their realised gains as a safety net for running big T2 trades? 25k bet on a ticker with good depth or good ann and a 5% gain is like $1250 profit that you keep for yourself - worst case you sell off at 10% down and dip into your "bank" of 50k (for example) sitting in your CDIA to cover it while offsetting your CGT.

Is it a viable strategy, or a case of the market being too volatile to win more than you lose?</body>

    <body>But I mean your actual gains rather than your portfolio. So having 50k as a bank of sorts to day trade and not holding any stocks more than a day or two.

I don't have 50k to do this for the record but further down the line I see this as a much less risky way of making quick gains over bag holding forever</body>

  <body>Surprised no one is talking about RNT hitting 1 million resumes on there site with 700+ new resumes daily. Incredible report, and a highly user centric company

The average age of the renters is 18 - 34. I suspect the ‚Äòbuying‚Äô market gap is only going to increase as housing prices continue. I have so many friends that are struggling to find places to rent right now, so obviously something is up 

Rent pay getting launched soon early this year will be a big changer in the renter market.

  <body>Bring on Monday, weekends are a bore. Got a fair bit of cash in Australis Oil and Gas (ATS) 

Market Cap: 55.21M
Current Price: 0.056

Fundamentals - 2019 Annual Report (USD)

‚Ä¢ $53m Revenue (+56% YoY)

‚Ä¢ EBITDAX 14m (+638%)

‚Ä¢ Net profit after tax $7m (+8415%)

‚Ä¢ Earnings per share $0.391 (+5.4%)

‚Ä¢ Debt $33m

‚Ä¢ Cash $16m

Australis Oil &amp; Gas (Australis) is an oil and gas company formed by the founder and executives of Aurora Oil &amp; Gas Limited (Aurora), which was sold in June 2014 for an enterprise value of A$2.6 billion including assumed debt of approximately A$800 million ($4.10 a share). In essence, the founders of Aurora pursues a countercyclical acquisition strategy at the bottom end of the industry cycle, which could provide value to shareholders if successful executed.

Here the founders an executives are attempting to re-create that success again in Through two acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 and an ongoing leasing program, Australis has accumulated a strategic position within one of the last emerging oil shale basins onshore in the USA.  Australis has become the largest acreage holder in the production defined core area of the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale (TMS), onshore Louisiana and Mississippi. TMS is a largely undeveloped play with a bucketload of proven reserves. It‚Äôs also not on federal land, so as Biden squeezes drilling in the coming months, the TMS is going to become attractive for developers. Indeed, there are already some players coming in. ATS has the most significant land hold of anyone. 

Australis has a clear "in and out" strategy, which is what I like. Management will look to sell or JV at a time when the price of oil is cyclically appealing, hopefully providing shareholders with significant capital gains in the process. 

Obviously COVID has significantly impacted the oil industry, however ATS had a hedge book of about 8.2m (priced between $51 - $55 per barrel) which has protected them from the worst of it. In addition, management are financially prudent and have ensured that the business remains sustainable in the downward cycles. My expectation is that ATS will continue to post operating profit while other on-shore companies have struggled to remain viable. This years annual report will show impairments which are no surprises in this industry, however operating profit will remain positive. 

IG has recently listed this as the top Penny Stock for 2021 https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.ig.com/au/trading-strategies/top-10-asx-penny-stocks-for-traders-200107.amp

   <body>Wait and see. Spud should be announced  early next week, then regular updates after that. IF they hit recoverable gas at good pressure, its only 5km to hook up to a major supply line. Not the multi bag rocket we were hoping for but we'll get some profits. Or the well is dry and we're all crying into ramen for a while</body>
