     <body>- Low MC/SOI. 
- It’s prospective resources would be the largest in the world. 
- The grades are potentially between 2-12%, compare that to the US with grades of 0.35%. 
- They plan to go into production this year
- Helium shortage
- The first zero carbon emission solution for cold chain logistics, this is an open source so basically anyone can use the technology for free. But ethically I really like that about RLT, good on them for being green and forward thinking. 

Current MC of 120odd mil 
Below gives you an idea of what it could hit depending on the resource. 
P90 = 32BCF worth $8.9Bn
P50 = 106BCF worth $29.4Bn
P10 = 344BCF worth $95.67Bn

Look at the US helium company Linde, 140bilMC. 
If Renergen hits anything close to what they think they have underground then watch out, this will move and move quick because of the tight share registry. 

There just a few points I remember off the top of my head, have a listen to Stefans interviews and videos, sounds like a good story anyway and definitely worth the gamble on a potentially multi billion dollar business if it all lines up.

Edit: Forgot to chuck in that they have about 24mil USD on hand for operational costs, 3 years worth approximately, so don’t worry about CR’s.</body>

     <body>Very quick summary, they are expanding extremely quick have 2 new contract expansions which have not been reflected in share price. Capex is expected to stay the same roughly while revenue and earnings rise by 20-25% 
It's also partly an infrastructure play with how much land they own. Business plan going forward is very simple with expansions in wa and qld over the upcoming years. Vic and Nsw are currently their most dominant areas.

Edit: if you want a longer dd message me and I'll type one up</body>

  <body>NVA - Bought more today at 0.160. Seems people just been selling over the past few weeks as no new announcement. Hoping for a boom, similar to last time, once announcement/financials.

VR1 - Not selling at .145 was probably the wrong move as it has dipped again.  Let's hope quarterly financial results are better than previous times.</body>

   <body>i sold VR1, not convinced they can report well and afraid i will be caught bag holding. Sold at 0.135 for small profit. 

Bought more shares in NVA and hoping announcements start to flow, their lithium project has also got some naughty potential.</body>

     <body>Yes, you learn from your mistake, and this is a pretty common scenario, I believe most people on this sub did this at some point, it's a painful lesson.

There are a few things you could do to avoid making similar mistakes in the future:

1. Look at gap ups, many of them, and notice the similarities in patterns (open high, run for a bit, dip hard, recover, and occasionally recovers to day-high by end of day)

2. Know what you're buying into. Get used to skimming for information quickly on the latest announcements, understand if it's something with substance or just bs pumps. Know the value behind the pump, if the company seems dogshit and announcement was full of fluff, cutting losses could be the wiser choice. Otherwise, walk away from the screen and check back in later if the company is good.

3. Learn some tea leaves voodoo magic. You don't have to believe in it, just have to know that many people do. When a stock is showing overbought, it is likely that people would sell to take profit, and if it's oversold, people would buy to wait for profit. Many traders use technical analysis a guidance for their entry/exit, that psychology would drive volume and give you better conviction in making your buy/hold/sell decision.

The more you know, the more confidence you have.

It's a fucking huge drop I hope you didn't commit too much of your capital into it broooo</body>

   <body>Whenever im down the best thing to do is not YOLO or FOMO. Sit down , do some research and make some calculated moves. Set your buying / entry points and then play the waiting game to get in at your desired price.

Also sometimes it pays to cut losses and move money into something that's better (but not always, you can lose a lot of money doing that). You make the calls depending on whether it's a dogshit stock or whether it has a chance to come back up.</body>

    <body>Very quick summary, they are expanding extremely quick have 2 new contract expansions which have not been reflected in share price. Capex is expected to stay the same roughly while revenue and earnings rise by 20-25% 
It's also partly an infrastructure play with how much land they own. Business plan going forward is very simple with expansions in wa and qld over the upcoming years. Vic and Nsw are currently their most dominant areas.

Maybe if you were 100% in on something like CHN from the start but even that pulled back heaps.

   <body>i bought more at 0.6

their financials are superb and they continue to grow.

whats happening now (in my humble stanky opinion) is the bagholders that bought at the previous peak of \~0.7 are shedding as they about as close as they reckon they'll get to break even.

this is one of those shares i intend to accumulate over time... currently i hold $20k worth and intend to continue to bank in there...

    <body>**[Cherenkov radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov radiation)**

Cherenkov radiation (; Russian: Черенков) is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity (speed of propagation of a wave in a medium) of light in that medium. Special relativity is not violated since light travels slower in materials with refractive index greater than one, and it is the speed of light in a vacuum which cannot be reached (or exceeded) by particles with mass. A classic example of Cherenkov radiation is the characteristic blue glow of an underwater nuclear reactor. Its cause is similar to the cause of a sonic boom, the sharp sound heard when faster-than-sound movement occurs.

  <body>AVA strong close which is awesome. Expecting another run up tomorrow on open. Hopefully into the 70s.

CLT has been dumped but looks like a very nice entry point for those who like risky trades with high Reward (has a nice quarterly announcement coming). I suspect a pump and dump scenario occurred the first round and now is the accumulation phase for the next round , will rocket on the announcement (i could be wrong so proceed with caution)

HT8 - i had to exit the other day to buy more AVA (luckily paid off). And also, congrats to those who sold between 20-21.5 . For those that didn't,  the announcement is still on the way so don't stress. I think if it breaks 0.22 its going to head closer to 30c. But if it hovers around 22c it'll dip back to where it is now. Would buy in if my cash wasn't stuck in the other 2</body>

Bought into it in the first place based on a post here a while back and thought it was only fitting to spend the gains from it onto another stock from here (went 50/50 into AV1 and ANP.

      <body>I mean, we're all essentially gambling here, my point is that a stock that's gone up ~440% in a year might be less likely to have the same rocket energy as something else waiting out there, I'm still with you loving TNT as its my biggest bag so far</body>

Got stop losses in for nc6 and vul tomoz, but would not be surprised to see both still keep going.

  <body>TYR is looking cheap as chips atm.. down -9% today. Anyone thinking about going in? 

Their EFTPOS devices are currently having issues across Aus with a large portion of them going offline (thus not being able to transact). I just spoke to a local business owner who uses Tyro as their payment merchant and they're affected pretty badly, in the sense that only one of the three tyro machines they use currently is working.

I asked them if they're looking to switch but he said it wasn't enough to turn them away from Tyro as they have the lowest fees.

Not sure how to feel, perhaps it's a long hold?

EDIT: TYR just put on a trading halt at 11:50am, will be interesting to see what happens..</body>

  <body>I've slowly reduced my holdings from 8+ down to 4... Looking to cut a few more tbh, I'm moving towards holding only 1 - 3 high-conviction stocks, swing trading, then cutting and moving on.   
On that note, if CI1 drops more I'll be snapping it up.</body>

  <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="itsdankreddit" created="2021-01-15 10:26:45+10:00">
   <body>Not dead, just churning through options from the previous directors of the company prior to takeover. It use to be known as DaWine. It's a good buying opportunity prior to the 4C which may cause a re-rate as the expected revenue is on a run rate of 4.3 million a year. That could cause based on conservative multiples, a share price of around 6.8c conservatively prior to B2B. 

My 6 month price target is 15 cents based on B2B and B2C alone and once that's all setup they've got international expansion in mind, having announced that they will look at the US, UK and Singapore first. 

As of posting, I have just over 90,000 worth of shares (2.02 million units).</body>

    <body>I don't even know if its worth waiting for a pullback at this point since it very well could keep rocketing past $7 considering they're giving it a price target of $9.50.

I think I may need to perform a cum tribute tonight on two sheets of paper both enscribed FOMO or WAIT and whichever sheet gathers the most of my droplets will be the action I take.</body>

   <body>LKE for sure, underrated asf (renewable lithium is the future for ev’s). its only just starting to get the recognition it deserves and analysts reckon its undervalued and worth at least 30c. its currently a year ahead of VUL in production (LKE is already on the definitive feasibility study whereas VUL just got results from their pre feasibility study). they have projects in the cheapest and largest lithium brine in the world (argentina). it dosent have as good a management as vulcan, but imo its definitely worth a punt. its currently at 0.115 (up 45% this week) and its got heaps more to go🤞🚀🚀</body>

   <body>Congrats. What's your return so far? 

I'd be taking profits around now as I can't predict how much higher APT will go.

same for APT after today’s 10% increase

  <body>Picked up some **RAC** as they've got enormous potential with their impending results for anti-cancer trials. 

Also purchased a speculative amount of **KRM**, as they currently have a negative enterprise value and a new board of very qualified executives. KRM has $37m in the bank and a market cap of $25m. With the current stock price at $0.043 it's well worth a look IMO.

And also topped up my **PBH** holdings as they've got plenty of sunny horizons ahead with their US expansion plans.</body>

  <body>Bought a chunk of wcn this morning @ .028 


Happy with vml for last week or so, strongly building. Might buy more next week if price drops below .034


Couldn't pull the pin on ava today, will probably regret this, but enough getting burnt for buying hype this week..</body>

   <body>What is appealing about rlt to you? Haven’t done my own dd</body>

    <body>- Low MC/SOI. 
- It’s prospective resources would be the largest in the world. 
- The grades are potentially between 2-12%, compare that to the US with grades of 0.35%. 
- They plan to go into production this year
- Helium shortage
- The first zero carbon emission solution for cold chain logistics, this is an open source so basically anyone can use the technology for free. But ethically I really like that about RLT, good on them for being green and forward thinking. 

Current MC of 120odd mil 
Below gives you an idea of what it could hit depending on the resource. 
P90 = 32BCF worth $8.9Bn
P50 = 106BCF worth $29.4Bn
P10 = 344BCF worth $95.67Bn

Look at the US helium company Linde, 140bilMC. 
If Renergen hits anything close to what they think they have underground then watch out, this will move and move quick because of the tight share registry. 

There just a few points I remember off the top of my head, have a listen to Stefans interviews and videos, sounds like a good story anyway and definitely worth the gamble on a potentially multi billion dollar business if it all lines up.

Edit: Forgot to chuck in that they have about 24mil USD on hand for operational costs, 3 years worth approximately, so don’t worry about CR’s.</body>
