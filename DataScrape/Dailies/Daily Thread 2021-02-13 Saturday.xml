    <body>Why do you think this is a bullish sign?

From my shallow understanding, lower VIX = lower volatility (higher stability)

Since VIX is linked to options-trading, I assume lower VIX level means fewer investors are hedging with options - let's look at that as a traditional hedging strategy.

What if this means big money are hedging with other methods, and smaller money are simply... not hedging? 

Anyway, I know very little about VIX, and macro, and indices, would like to see what kind of discussion this would spark.

     <body>VIX is an implied volatility index which is trying to estimate the market(S&amp;P 500) volatility in the next 30days. The reason why high is bad and low is good has a lot to do with human‚Äôs action and decision. 
Generally, when people panic they will sell at a very high pace cause price drop very steep very quickly leading increasing the volatility.  But they will buy it back slowly which lead to slow peace in price increase hence lower volatility. This is the reason why high VIX is bad and low is good.</body>
     <comment ups="4" downs="0" author="overdose_on_Telfast" created="2021-02-14 00:28:03+10:00">
      <body>I understand what you're saying, just the metrics that you described (trading activities) are lagging indicators, but VIX is a forward indicator that uses options' implied volatility to make its forward estimations.

The high VIX level from the past year - a raging bull market environment, doesn't fit the "sell at high pace, buy at low pace" narrative, but instead, we saw mostly "buy at high pace, sell at maybe high pace, too" scenarios. 

SPX has broken preCovid ATH since August, and keeps making ATH recently. Could this drop in VIX level implies that the market starts viewing the bulls are running out of steam, that the peak is not far away, but maybe still skeptical, holding on to hope, and bears have not stepped in yet, hence the slow down in buying but have not sped up in selling, which lowered the volatility? 

Just my speculations.</body>
      <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="B3lack" created="2021-02-14 01:01:03+10:00" sentiment="TIP 5">
       <body>It is not the volume that impact VIX but rather the expected future price changes over a given time frame(both up and down). However, it is usually the selling during panic that lead to greatest price change in the shortest time.

 For example if we look at Covid19 impact. It take about a month for S&amp;P500 to reach its lowest point from around 3300. But it take approximately 5months to reach its precovid level of 3300. 

Your speculation is right because low VIX is a double edged sword. On one hand it could mean stable rise in price but on other hand it also could mean investor drive the price up so high that no one want to push it higher thus creating a resistance point which tend to lead to a draw down/correction. So it is always good idea to use it in conjunction with other indicators.</body>

     <body>I honestly don‚Äôt know enough about the hedging side of things but the excerpt from the article below was enough for me to remain bullish. I‚Äôve actually been feeling a little bearish lately funnily enough but I‚Äôll continue to chase rockets while the goings good.



Among the reasons for the shifting sentiment are hopes for President Joe Biden‚Äôs $US1.9 trillion ($2.4 trillion) relief plan, better than expected quarterly results and a rising vaccination rate in the US.

President Biden has indicated he will move forward with his plan without Republican support. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is working towards having legislation on the President‚Äôs desk by March 14.

In its latest review of reporting season, FactSet said: ‚ÄùAt this point in time, more S&amp;P 500 companies are beating EPS estimates for the fourth quarter than average, and beating EPS estimates by a wider margin than average.

‚ÄúAs a result, the index is reporting higher earnings for the fourth quarter today relative to the end of last week and relative to the end of the quarter. Due to this increase in earnings over the past few weeks, the index is now reporting year-over-year growth in earnings in Q4 2020 for the first time since Q4 2019.

‚ÄúAnalysts expect double-digit earnings growth for all four quarters of 2021.‚Äù

As for vaccinations, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said 35.8 million people in the US have received at least one dose; slightly more than 12 million have received two doses.</body>

**VRX**

Highlights

* The combined post-tax NPV10 of $727.8 million for 3 projects
* Native title clearance completed
* Environmental approval for Arrowsmith Nth Approved 12 Feb 21 (Announcement likely next week)
* All mining leases approved
* Offtakes expected any moment with construction beginning mid year
* Sufficient Cash on hand for regulatory means
* Site locations to endure a lifetime of mining combined
* MC only $164 Million at 32.5c
* Over 50 interested parties for sales across varies Asian countries

In my eyes VRX is one of the best commodity plays on the ASX as they are positioned to exploit a growing global demand for Silica as constructions ramps up around the world again. They are also incredibly close to production compared to any large resource speccies with the majority of regulatory approvals given for all 3 projects. 

I'm not going to drawl on my keyboard saying $1 June but I think it does a provide a relatively lower risk / high reward. I suspect better valuations will be provides after the terms of sales are released.</body>

    <body>Dude im cock and balls deep in VRX...Once offtakes announced this thing will go nuts i think. I was thinking $1 by years end...60 cents by June only for the fact that we have this whole EV thing going and people dumping cash into pump n dumps...price could easily rocket.

Market cap of 1B isnt out of the question in near future

Silica sand plays are overlooked because its not "sexy" or a meme but fark me, the margin on VRX will sell this sand for with, 100 year mine life AND the massive demand and supply shortage....its a no brainer.

Maybe someone can do a huge DD on this company or silica sand sector...everyone sleeping on it</body>

    <body>NPV is solid. Is the high demand for silica enough to push the price higher? Is the silica market quite saturated with competitors at the moment? I‚Äôm assuming they don‚Äôt have any supply contracts in place yet? Still looks reasonable. I‚Äôm assuming a supply contract will be a catalyst for SP increase?</body>

    <body>There's no right answer to this, but I typically go with about 7% of my bankroll - so at any given time I'm typically holding about 14 stocks. To me, that gives enough diversity so that no single stock can fuck me up too hard, and there's decent (but not fantastic) gains on anything that rockets.

Saying that, if there's a something I'm particularly convinced by I'll go in bigger. All up to you, but holding a single stock is way too risky for my liking, and too many dilutes your potential, so maybe holding 10-12 is a good compromise?

   <body>Yeah I've ben holding around a year, averaging up (avg 9c).

Very tempting to buy more at these levels, 14.5c was a large discount to the CR.

POG obviously having an impact. The updated JORC will be big  depending Moz could be a catalyst. Otherwise starting the permitting process.

Hard to tell if its retail baggies getting bored with it, or a larger holder selling down. Havnt seen broker data</body>

  <body>Well, I've done my DD and will be buying into HFY this week... interesting mix of IT/business cloud services. The fact that management/the board own 67% of the share register sealed the deal for me on top of everything else looking about as strong as a penny can get.

I don't think I've seen anyone else ever mention it on here (at least not according to search &amp; Google) so wish me luck boyos...

* *Revenues from ordinary activities up 23.6% to $8,966,986*
* *Profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) up 78.3% to $1,215,957*
* *Profit before income tax up 125.3% to $775,905*
* *Profit after income tax (attributable to ordinary equity holders) ‚Äì normalised\* up 160.9% to $651,564*
* *Cash and cash equivalents up 136.2% to $6,847,171*

  <body>Okay Uranium gang ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è, Fukushima had a big 7.1 earthquake last night, the media narrative that gets spun from this could be a turning point for good or bad this year.

No nuclear incidents have been reported, which is expected as the 2011 Fukishima meltdown was caused by the Tsunami trigged from a ginormous 9.1 earthquake.

Bear in mind that this terrible incident was a failure in providing basic safety requirements, most critically the Fukishima plant Sea wall (19 ft) was criminally small, the Onagawa nuclear plant closer to the shoreline survived without incident with their 46 ft Sea wall.

Fingers crossed, this earthquake might be bullish if all nuclear facilities can display that their safety requirements meant that this was nothing. On the bear case, this earthquake could reignite the media into playing up fear against the nuclear industry again. Fingers crossed</body>

    <body>solid company. 

can‚Äôt see any major growth though for the following reasons

- mattress component side of their business only addresses is tiny market - if they had FULL market share of the components they do it‚Äôd be a total of $31M. so they could be the best in mattress coverings but $31M is the whole market. tiny. they have maybe 20% market share here currently 

- if they can expand to all components of bedding, that market is still only around $200M - inclusive of that $31M. 


going through all of their markets, their products only address $600M - globally. this is tiny compared to companies entering multi billion or even trillion dollar niche markets like plus sized men‚Äôs clothing, vegan health food, strategic mobile games etc. 

IMO it‚Äôs a really good company but it‚Äôs just too niche to produce excellent growth over the years unless they expand their product range significantly. 

but there‚Äôs definitely worse places to put your money and it‚Äôd probably outperform vanguard.</body>

It pumped like 150% in a few days and now has retraced a bit and hit support at 2.2c/2.3c.

Good buy in price. Will hit 5 cents by June easily and when final investment decisions are made- rockets could hit 10c by year end. Thats x5 your investment.

   <body>Why do you think this is a bullish sign?

From my shallow understanding, lower VIX = lower volatility (higher stability)

Since VIX is linked to options-trading, I assume lower VIX level means fewer investors are hedging with options - let's look at that as a traditional hedging strategy.

What if this means big money are hedging with other methods, and smaller money are simply... not hedging? 

Anyway, I know very little about VIX, and macro, and indices, would like to see what kind of discussion this would spark.

   <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="B3lack" created="2021-02-13 23:53:55+10:00">
    <body>VIX is an implied volatility index which is trying to estimate the market(S&amp;P 500) volatility in the next 30days. The reason why high is bad and low is good has a lot to do with human‚Äôs action and decision. 
Generally, when people panic they will sell at a very high pace cause price drop very steep very quickly leading increasing the volatility.  But they will buy it back slowly which lead to slow peace in price increase hence lower volatility. This is the reason why high VIX is bad and low is good.</body>
    <comment ups="4" downs="0" author="overdose_on_Telfast" created="2021-02-14 00:28:03+10:00">
     <body>I understand what you're saying, just the metrics that you described (trading activities) are lagging indicators, but VIX is a forward indicator that uses options' implied volatility to make its forward estimations.

The high VIX level from the past year - a raging bull market environment, doesn't fit the "sell at high pace, buy at low pace" narrative, but instead, we saw mostly "buy at high pace, sell at maybe high pace, too" scenarios. 

SPX has broken preCovid ATH since August, and keeps making ATH recently. Could this drop in VIX level implies that the market starts viewing the bulls are running out of steam, that the peak is not far away, but maybe still skeptical, holding on to hope, and bears have not stepped in yet, hence the slow down in buying but have not sped up in selling, which lowered the volatility? 

Just my speculations.</body>
     <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="B3lack" created="2021-02-14 01:01:03+10:00">
      <body>It is not the volume that impact VIX but rather the expected future price changes over a given time frame(both up and down). However, it is usually the selling during panic that lead to greatest price change in the shortest time.

 For example if we look at Covid19 impact. It take about a month for S&amp;P500 to reach its lowest point from around 3300. But it take approximately 5months to reach its precovid level of 3300. 

Your speculation is right because low VIX is a double edged sword. On one hand it could mean stable rise in price but on other hand it also could mean investor drive the price up so high that no one want to push it higher thus creating a resistance point which tend to lead to a draw down/correction. So it is always good idea to use it in conjunction with other indicators.</body>

    <body>I honestly don‚Äôt know enough about the hedging side of things but the excerpt from the article below was enough for me to remain bullish. I‚Äôve actually been feeling a little bearish lately funnily enough but I‚Äôll continue to chase rockets while the goings good.



Among the reasons for the shifting sentiment are hopes for President Joe Biden‚Äôs $US1.9 trillion ($2.4 trillion) relief plan, better than expected quarterly results and a rising vaccination rate in the US.

President Biden has indicated he will move forward with his plan without Republican support. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is working towards having legislation on the President‚Äôs desk by March 14.

In its latest review of reporting season, FactSet said: ‚ÄùAt this point in time, more S&amp;P 500 companies are beating EPS estimates for the fourth quarter than average, and beating EPS estimates by a wider margin than average.

‚ÄúAs a result, the index is reporting higher earnings for the fourth quarter today relative to the end of last week and relative to the end of the quarter. Due to this increase in earnings over the past few weeks, the index is now reporting year-over-year growth in earnings in Q4 2020 for the first time since Q4 2019.

‚ÄúAnalysts expect double-digit earnings growth for all four quarters of 2021.‚Äù

As for vaccinations, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said 35.8 million people in the US have received at least one dose; slightly more than 12 million have received two doses.</body>

Best case you will save yourself heaps of coin by not having to pay for the course. Being an investor is not the same as being a doctor. You do not need some kind of certificate.</body>

  <body>OAR in trading halt pending results - Wednesday. Been holding for a while so I‚Äôm excited.
Other than that - holding
GRR
NOX
RAC
VML 
And Z1P

Sold out of EGR at $1.05 at open. Pretty happy but a bit upset that I was going to get $1.20 before the halt. But the gains were still good.

Haven‚Äôt put that money back in yet, thinking more VML or maybe get back into 4DS while it‚Äôs down.</body>

**VRX**

Highlights

* The combined post-tax NPV10 of $727.8 million for 3 projects
* Native title clearance completed
* Environmental approval for Arrowsmith Nth Approved 12 Feb 21 (Announcement likely next week)
* All mining leases approved
* Offtakes expected any moment with construction beginning mid year
* Sufficient Cash on hand for regulatory means
* Site locations to endure a lifetime of mining combined
* MC only $164 Million at 32.5c
* Over 50 interested parties for sales across varies Asian countries

In my eyes VRX is one of the best commodity plays on the ASX as they are positioned to exploit a growing global demand for Silica as constructions ramps up around the world again. They are also incredibly close to production compared to any large resource speccies with the majority of regulatory approvals given for all 3 projects. 

I'm not going to drawl on my keyboard saying $1 June but I think it does a provide a relatively lower risk / high reward. I suspect better valuations will be provides after the terms of sales are released.</body>
  <comment ups="7" downs="0" author="ElonzMusc" created="2021-02-13 09:29:19+10:00">
   <body>Dude im cock and balls deep in VRX...Once offtakes announced this thing will go nuts i think. I was thinking $1 by years end...60 cents by June only for the fact that we have this whole EV thing going and people dumping cash into pump n dumps...price could easily rocket.

Market cap of 1B isnt out of the question in near future

Silica sand plays are overlooked because its not "sexy" or a meme but fark me, the margin on VRX will sell this sand for with, 100 year mine life AND the massive demand and supply shortage....its a no brainer.

Maybe someone can do a huge DD on this company or silica sand sector...everyone sleeping on it</body>

   <body>NPV is solid. Is the high demand for silica enough to push the price higher? Is the silica market quite saturated with competitors at the moment? I‚Äôm assuming they don‚Äôt have any supply contracts in place yet? Still looks reasonable. I‚Äôm assuming a supply contract will be a catalyst for SP increase?</body>

   <body>Agree. I like RAC and get the argmument low SOI etc. but realistically it's at Phase 1 initiation stage. For super low SOI with similar lab efficacy and also in Phase 1 check out VBS. For more progress (recent) than RAC in oncology and a crack team check out IMU.

As it's a lottery I always back a few inc IMU, VBS, RAC, NYR, OCC. RAC might give you a good ride for a few mths but theyre're all promising a cure for cancer, fibrosis etc. so long term who knows..</body>
   <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="SAIUN666" created="2021-02-14 04:59:15+10:00">
    <body>Phase 1 isn't necessary as that was already done for Bisantrene a long time ago, safe dosage ranges are well-known.

RAC are fairly unique in the biotech world because of the numerous historical trials. This takes away a huge amount of risk that might otherwise be present.

I agree biotech is risky. We saw DXB crash and burn, we've seen countless bagholders due to MSB stuffing things up. But RAC don't present the same risks IMO.</body>
    <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="CzarMikhail" created="2021-02-14 08:48:44+10:00">
     <body>Know too many Oncologists and Haematologists invested in RAC. Normally BioTech is something I stay clear of but can't see much risk in RAC.Also from a clinial maturity standpoint, you need to remember Bisantrene (RAC) was previously approved in France and historically trialled in over 2,000 patients. Safer than the dominant Chemo Drug (Doxorubicin) and survival rate pretty much the same. Average response rate for AML was just under 50% (From memory), all you need is above 20% to be approved by the FDA. Having the clinical maturity and historic data will allow RAC to pursue accelarated approval too, and save money on the pricey phase III trials.

    <body>Ok you asked for it. Off the top of my head:

- DFS not due until 2022. 
- Production not starting until 2024 (assuming it gets up and assuming no delays). 
- PFS IRR not that impressive (22% post-tax). 
- PFS NPV is only 4x the current market cap at $0.31c so it‚Äôs already run very hard when compared to its NPV for a pre-production pre-DFS company. On that metric I‚Äôd say the current share price is fair if not slightly over bought on hype. 
- There‚Äôs nearly 100 million unlisted options which aren‚Äôt factored into the share price/market cap. This is on top of the 51 million listed options. 
- Everyone is shitting themselves about a potential NVX deal, but NVX themselves are running on hype rather than substance.

Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger.</body>

   <body>In short- uranium shortage with huge demand. USA government wanting to buy massive reserves and will be building new reactors. Uranium price also to jump higher

USA department of energy most likely will buy uranium from an american mine i.e PEN and its also listed overseas on the american market with big exposure to uranium ETFs

6 months to start the mine after offtakes and agreements are announced.

Its a patience play- wont rocket like 70% over night but looking at x2 or x3 times your investment by years end...the 0.15c buy price is prettty good and price is stable so its a good time to buy right now</body>

  <comment ups="19" downs="0" author="Mutated_Cunt" created="2021-02-13 14:13:18+10:00">
   <body>The main argument against Z1P is that it is a business with a very small moat. The BNPL model is easy to copy, and presently there is no reason for a customer to stay loyal to a given brand. If you were around here in August/Sept last year, we watched Z1P climb above $10, then Paypal announced they were looking into expanding into the BNPL sector, which immediately sent it crashing back down below $5. Now it has rallied again above $10 on the basis of new institutional support. I managed to exit on 10% profit last time this happened, but I'm not going near Z1P or any other BNPL company again.</body>

    <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="Mutated_Cunt" created="2021-02-13 15:10:20+10:00">
     <body>Check the history of each ticker, APT was ~$90 at the end of August,  dropped ~20% in the following month to ~$70, but since then has more than recovered and continued its insane bull run and now sitting at a sexy $150. The market has decided that APT is a big enough player to withstand a hit from a giant like Paypal entering. 

The BNPL industry is a game to establish the largest customer base as fast as possible, ignoring profits in the short term like a silicon valley unicorn. They are assuming once they can establish themselves in each region, they can turn profits. I don't agree with this premise anymore so I'm staying away. For anyone looking at Z1P, Buy now, beware later</body>

   <body>Not profitable, which means it can only continue to operate through further equity raising (share dilution) or debt. One advantage over Afterpay is that it‚Äôs accepted anywhere credit cards are, but their margins are really low. When a space is crowded with the same product (i.e. BNPL) you can only compete on price which will push profitability further and further away.</body>

   <body>My support is based on it already being available and seen (only know this and afterpay), and being a weirdly old minded millennial, I'm yet to adopt these services because they genuinely seem to good to be true.
I've researched the popular ones enough to know that zip is probably the better of them.

I think the current generation don't really give a fuck, and will use what's available to them. For late adaptors who probably actually look into it, because it feels like there would be more fine print than there is, I think zip would be the choice.

What does that mean to me? I think Z1p and afterpay will be the two big players here, and Z1P has the most growing to do.

  <body>Who likes boomer money? Guaranteed 17.5% return in just over a month if you can get in and out 
BCN Beacan minerals announced a .007 div with a current share price of .04. So if you get at .04 which I'd say is doable as some¬† shareholders have to sell shares to convert options and this is a small gold miner whose not really well known.
Ex date is 18th of march record date is 19th of march. 
I had 80,000 shares at .037 but when I saw this on Friday afternoon before close I grabbed another 300000 shares.
I think the gold bugs &amp; boomer will swarm this so if it hits 6c I'll sell and not hold for div, or get div n dump on the following day.</body>

   <body>your thought process is not unique, although an observant one...

problem is, whoever that are already holding will (logically should) sell as soon as they have a paper profit of more than $0.007, because why risk the sell off on the day after ex-div when you could've cashed in the same profit now?

penny stocks carry high risks so it's sensible to do this. The situation could be different if you're holding blue chips, but I doubt, since there is almost guaranteed a sell off on the day after ex-div, that gives a good buy opportunity if the strategy is long-term holding</body>

   <body>There's no right answer to this, but I typically go with about 7% of my bankroll - so at any given time I'm typically holding about 14 stocks. To me, that gives enough diversity so that no single stock can fuck me up too hard, and there's decent (but not fantastic) gains on anything that rockets.

Saying that, if there's a something I'm particularly convinced by I'll go in bigger. All up to you, but holding a single stock is way too risky for my liking, and too many dilutes your potential, so maybe holding 10-12 is a good compromise?

   <body>I like LPD due to the mine having lithium and also 2 rare earth's, both on the US strategic list, that are produced as a by product. They also have an extraction process they are going to be licencing out that allows shit quality lithium spodumene to be made into high purity lithium and it's cheaper than standard processes supposedly.

Mine isn't the largest though and is located in Namibia so bit of risk there. I'm currently bag holding as I bought in on a pump but I'm going to keep holding it as it seems like a decent punt to me.</body>

   <body>I don't use them but I'm considering it because I'm on Telstra Velocity FTTH which is locked at 30/1 and has no competition since it's a contract with the developer. They've been bought out but could take a couple of years to get upgrades.

Pentanet has a great reputation here. Their pricing is on the high end but customer service, installs, support, and reliability of the service is all apparently very strong. They use their own towers and will not install if you don't have good line of sight. They keep building new towers also.

I'm quite keen to get into 5GG along with a couple of others (PEN, KSL, PEC) but haven't freed up the cash yet.</body>

   <body>i only had a brief look in which i realized it's competing with another forgotten drug from the 80/90s which seems to work in a similar way. a doc involved with RAC (i forget if he's on the board or something else high up) often posts on HC representing the company and adding fuel to the hopium fire. at that point, and given how much it's gone up already i decided to nope out of taking a dip. 

It also doesn't help that bio techs are pretty brutal to hold when things don't live up to overhyped expectations, something i've seen first hand before. so my threshold for getting in on one for longer than a quick trade is very high these days. but always happy to read opinions about the drug and its prospects from those actually in the field.</body>

  <body>Is TA a meme or can you actually get information about price action by drawing meme triangles over candlesticks?</body>
  <comment ups="10" downs="0" author="overdose_on_Telfast" created="2021-02-14 11:34:41+10:00">
   <body>It's a visual representation of market psychology. When it works, it's because many people believe that it works.

Let's use support and resistance levels as example:

One trader found a few support and resistance levels on a chart based on the price history, using the common metric most traders find support and resistance with.

One glance at the market depth, there are huge buy/sell walls at those levels.

Why?

Because the common metric to find support and resistance were used by many other traders, and since many people believe that those levels are where the price would turn in direction, they were perceived as the "top" or "bottom", hence the best entry/exit.

So, the traders put their orders at those levels. Those who don't do TA, but still wanted to buy at the cheapest possible price, or sell at the highest possible price, would put their orders around those levels because of the huge buy/sell walls. This turned a guesstimate into a reality.

TA doesn't predict fundamentals events, such as an unexpected dividend, a takeover rumour, unexpected huge cash injection from a star investor, or a rapid lockdown of economy due to a pandemic would drive hype/volume to break through those orders.

It's not a scam, but it is quite often used by scammers to sell courses to people who are too lazy to learn something themselves.</body>

   <body>Feel if you do it enough you can probably time your entries into stock quiet well (At least 80% good). Using it for pure trading I feel is too difficult, time consuming and needs a lot of experience. Protrader is a great tool to scan for stock, Frank Watkins owns Protrader and has some good books for trading using TA. He has used TA for day trading since the 80s. Normally on TA pages you see someone post a chart and 5 people argue different interpretations of said chart. Fundamentals always win IMO. TA is good for timing entries into a stock, and that's all. My opinion though, I know plenty swear by TA.</body>

   <body>It depends, stuff like OBV can be helpful, but really you can see OBV just looking at a normal price+volume chart, and it can be misleading e.g. big selloff all day, but a recovery to green on low volume at close will hide how shit that day was.


Candlesticks and line patterns are bullshit, Fibonacci retracement has so many points on it that it doesn't say anything. At the end of the day most indicators have been tested academically time and time again and the best ones give very little advantage over the market's movement.


TA is used by get rich quick scammers to make noobs feel like they know even less than they do.</body>

  <body>Would it be dumb to bet my retirement on lithium? As in, currently 50% of my pay each week ends up in an ETF (gross I know)  so would I be better just dumping that into various lithium producers such as LKE and USA companies? 

I see the upside of lithium being a gold rush 2.0 and could really speed up savings. 

Idk what do you guys think on the potential of lithium?</body>

   <body>I wouldn‚Äôt bet it all on Lithium even if you are bull on it.  Split it up a bit. I‚Äôm very bullish on it also but not to the tune of 100% of my portfolio. I would be putting some money in Graphite as well. Do you mean EV market?? That‚Äôs very different from Lithium. Last I looked, the amount of Graphite in a battery is like 10-15 times more than Lithium and because of losses in the production processs I think they need more like 20-30 times more graphite. Well EGR have gotten rid of most of that extra loss from my understanding but I‚Äôm not sure.

Also, car makers are not just going to pay higher and higher for it. The supply of Lithium might even overtake the demand in the next few years. I‚Äôm far from an expert though, I‚Äôm just an Autist trying to make some money like the rest of you.

But putting all your eggs in one basket is a saying for a reason. Sure people do it, but you would want to have an amazing knowledge of the industry. Way more than I have in any one field.

Now, if you said I‚Äôm going to put it all on one company, that I could understand better. Because it‚Äôs a lot easier to predict what one company can/is doing compared to entire supply chains in an industry that has lots of new players coming and the future demand is currently unknown.

But... What would I know. Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still hanging around places like this cause my balls are not big enough to put all my money on the one thing.</body>

  <comment ups="7" downs="0" author="Highlandcooz" created="2021-02-13 16:56:10+10:00">
   <body>I'm the guy that keeps saying it will dip (and hasn't yet). I sold at $2.9 after getting in at $1.7. So far I'm wrong. My thinking is the waves peak and then trough (at higher lows) for RAC. The story is cool (low SOI/Bisantrene) but if you read any other biotech you will find similar. Difference is a crack analyst on HC (Wombat) has created a superlative story for RAC even though it now needs to go completely through Phase 1 to prove it up ie we find out if right end 2021. There are 100's of other biotechs with potential 20-50x if they prove their shit this year. Since Bisantrene was created scientists around the world have created shitloads of other killer chemistry that we need to set RAC in the context of. Looking at it on its own (ie reviewing bisantrene in isolation) is probably not the way big pharma will do it..

All this said. If it dips and gets &lt;$2.4 (based on technicals) I'm back on but partly for the ride as I think the party bus is ripping it up and everyones on the kool juice for a while to come.</body>

    <body>Thats the thing. The Anns in March are generally about whats getting started. There's a long haul until anythings finished.. the potential is known but that now sets Bisantrene up for real comparison with its peers (globally). Don't just focus on RAC or what people say about it - there are a universe of drugs out there and if you follow endpoints news there are Anns from around the world every day in a similar space. 3 in March for RAC (about starting some trials) does not make it a $b co.

      <body>^^This! SGC is a better play based on Market cap and the 66% share in the Borba field alone.</body>

   <body>SGC has a pretty decent one which is the other party in the Borba hype</body>
   <comment ups="7" downs="0" author="Moxanz2" created="2021-02-14 12:11:23+10:00">
    <body>Ok I can figure out what SGC is doing since they have a website. Can someone tell me a bit more about XST?</body>
    <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="choomby93" created="2021-02-14 12:18:41+10:00">
     <body>If you look at the SGC announcements you will see that XST and their stake in the project is outlined. You can also look up XST on the ASX website and that will give you all of their announcements. 

XST and SGC are about to start drilling what has been rumoured to be a "multi-TCF" gas project in the Sacramento Basin in California. I'm not an expert but from what I've read, that's alot of gas in an under supplied market. There's other things in the works in Alberta but at the moment the Borba project is what the hype is about.</body>

  <body>So i'm selling everything else in my portfolio and going all in on KCN, they were shut down years back for alleged environmental violations in Thailand, got paid out by Zurich to fund their legal fight against the Thai government and now we're expecting a judgement ordering either the reopening of the mine or a 'uuuuge settlement before the end of Feb, I'm hearing projections of $5-$10 a share (their previous high when the mine was open and gold was cheaper), is anyone else in KCN and has any other news?

I haven't seen a single other mention of it on here at all so thought i'd make a post and see what's up.</body>

   <body>Banking on the outcome of a legal case involving environmental issues with a mining company initiated by the government.
You have big cajones to go all in on that one !</body>

   <body>You sir, sound like your holding losses. Benefit of the doubt, what‚Äôs the true upside?</body>
   <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="BoingMan" created="2021-02-12 22:37:28+10:00">
    <body>No I‚Äôm up at the moment, positions here: https://ibb.co/m4L4gnb

Upside is the value of the stock previously was trading around $10, gold prices are higher now, in my mind if the mine reopens and compensation is paid share price should be valued at least $10 minimum, if they decide to settle with the gov settlement is rumoured to be in the realm of $1.5bn or $5 a share.</body>
