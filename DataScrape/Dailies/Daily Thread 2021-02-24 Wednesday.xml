   <body>Went back in COD for an overnight hold for mostly the [same reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lphlgu/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gobhirt?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) as I did yesterday.

Wasn't going to look back at it after coping a 9% loss at open, but if LEX could do what it did today, I don't understand why COD can't at least have some small gains on top of the 53% yesterday, after the volume breakout and $11mil cash with a MC of $30mil. 

It was also a bit of a blind pick because I spent most of the day moving house and didn't really look at the movements. We'll see if this turned into an abusive relationship by tomorrow, maybe I do have some Stockholm Syndrome towards COD now.</body>

    <body>If you want a real speculative speccy check out SPQ. Share price currently depressed on a lack of news flow but a scoping study and MRE is due soon. Good grades from surface so it could be an easy shallow pit operation and into operation quickly if it all ads up. Very low MC so heaps of upside. Don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking it‚Äôs easy money tho - it could go nowhere. It‚Äôs a true risk/reward play. I‚Äôm in.

Edit - I also like LCL if you‚Äôre looking for a speccy. DEG is starting to look tasty at its current price. Maybe not quite there yet but it‚Äôs getting close. Some people on here are very big on NVA.</body>

    <body>I am deep into TNR. Numerous more assays to be released. Scheduled JORC upgrade by end of Q1 with more scheduled for Q2 and Q3.  Strike and Depth is open in all directions for Mt Stirling with assays to come to determine further width and depth.  Mt Stirling grade and depth closely matches that of Saracen and Saint Barbara. TNR has risen from about 2.6 to 5.8 over the last few weeks. It is also 13% owned by NVA. I feel the market is starting to catch on with the findings released over the last few weeks.</body>

      <body>They said they'd keep the market updated as the AEM flies and they extended the survey area for the East block recently, which they may have finished by now. Anyways I've been holding this since 3c just look at my previous posts/comments and have already free carried so no defs not going to be left with any bags. Don't deny the possibility of price query or pullback, just based announcement possibility on price movement maybe there's something coming soon with someone in the know or yes could be likely moving on nothing. You can fuck off just because you didn't buy no need for your disrespect mate.</body>

    <body>Take a moment to consider current and future technologies and what they need. The current future is extremely battery heavy, so lithium is huge. 

Tin looks to be the next advancement in lithium batteries, and since the USA don't mine tin, but need it, it's looking to be a killer resource going forward.

Lastly, with energy demand being higher and carbon emissions becoming stricter, uranium is looking mighty fine for most future power plants. Look at Australian news to see how gold the nuclear future looks.

Top stock picks seem LKE, MLX, PEN

My recommendations - MLX, LPD, LOT.

My stocks are based off my own DD. I highly recommend going for the top picks over my recommendations</body>

   <body>After spending the weekend (and more) doing a lot of thorough rational and logical investigations into a bunch of companies I saw race oncology fly and FOMO‚Äôd in this morning. It‚Äôs in my top five though so it was sort of OK. not super impressed with myself but I‚Äôll get there. At least it was on the damn list. 

If tomorrow can end up like yesterday started I will be pleased. My redflow hit 180% this week and now it‚Äôs down to 80%. Considering whether next time I should try the whole free carry experience. Try something new. Or just keep clenching on. üíé 
Who knows. 

CArnegie clean energy did pass .003c god knows why. It‚Äôs on some list with tassel group which also moved a bit (most shorted?) so maybe someone got interested. Dunno.

     <body>If you were around in September or so last year you would have seen a lot of people make money and even more do their arse on BRN, then straight after take like 75% losses on DXB.

A good loss makes you be more careful, I know I did.</body>

   <body>If you want a real speculative speccy check out SPQ. Share price currently depressed on a lack of news flow but a scoping study and MRE is due soon. Good grades from surface so it could be an easy shallow pit operation and into operation quickly if it all ads up. Very low MC so heaps of upside. Don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking it‚Äôs easy money tho - it could go nowhere. It‚Äôs a true risk/reward play. I‚Äôm in.

Edit - I also like LCL if you‚Äôre looking for a speccy. DEG is starting to look tasty at its current price. Maybe not quite there yet but it‚Äôs getting close. Some people on here are very big on NVA.</body>

It‚Äôs in my top five though so it was sort of OK. not super impressed with myself but I‚Äôll get there. At least it was on the damn list. 

If tomorrow can end up like yesterday started I will be pleased. My redflow hit 180% this week and now it‚Äôs down to 80%. Considering whether next time I should try the whole free carry experience. Try something new. Or just keep clenching on. üíé 
Who knows.

     <body>They said they'd keep the market updated as the AEM flies and they extended the survey area for the East block recently, which they may have finished by now. Anyways I've been holding this since 3c just look at my previous posts/comments and have already free carried so no defs not going to be left with any bags. Don't deny the possibility of price query or pullback, just based announcement possibility on price movement maybe there's something coming soon with someone in the know or yes could be likely moving on nothing. You can fuck off just because you didn't buy no need for your disrespect mate.</body>

   <body>Looked at this one. At $1 it's like 300x P/E off FY20. Even with 400% growth forecasted, it's still 70-80x P/E. Book value is only like 9cents too.

Too hot and heavy for my liking, but interesting concept. On watchlist. Might settle down into a normal price range at some stage over 12-18 months and there will be more info to work with at that point.</body>

  <body>Went back in COD for an overnight hold for mostly the [same reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lphlgu/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gobhirt?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) as I did yesterday.

Wasn't going to look back at it after coping a 9% loss at open, but if LEX could do what it did today, I don't understand why COD can't at least have some small gains on top of the 53% yesterday, after the volume breakout and $11mil cash with a MC of $30mil. 

It was also a bit of a blind pick because I spent most of the day moving house and didn't really look at the movements. We'll see if this turned into an abusive relationship by tomorrow, maybe I do have some Stockholm Syndrome towards COD now.</body>

   <body>Take a moment to consider current and future technologies and what they need. The current future is extremely battery heavy, so lithium is huge. 

Tin looks to be the next advancement in lithium batteries, and since the USA don't mine tin, but need it, it's looking to be a killer resource going forward.

Lastly, with energy demand being higher and carbon emissions becoming stricter, uranium is looking mighty fine for most future power plants. Look at Australian news to see how gold the nuclear future looks.

Top stock picks seem LKE, MLX, PEN

My recommendations - MLX, LPD, LOT.

My stocks are based off my own DD. I highly recommend going for the top picks over my recommendations</body>

     <body>Anyone I know that asks me about cfd's - I tell them to stay the fuck away from them. Having said that, I use them sometimes, for obvious trades - for practice. Real money but super low leverage, guaranteed stop losses way away from support. Sometimes I short my own stock for a hedge (FMG). I trade for $10 to $20 profit just for kicks. I used it to get exposure to GME in the US and gave the profit away. It's just for practice and unless you understand leverage and the default leverage you are exposed to when you are a noob - it will take every cent you have and can also take more money than you actually have. Google 'cfd's gone wrong' or something.</body>

     <body>Here we go.. mate , im a trader. Im in and out of many stocks all the time. I trade based on opportunities. I dont hold for long. I even post screenshots of my buy in prices on most occasions. When I got people into HT8 every single one of them was in profits. We got in sub 17-18c. Before the crash it was over 20c for days. I can't tell people when to sell their shares and I can't predict the future.

Same for AVA , we got in sub 55c and made great profits. 

I pump what I buy , the same as everyone else on this sub. 1000's of comments posting bullshit. Atleast my picks come with DD. Risk is still there for any stock, even with DD. Dont buy if you don't understand the risks.
