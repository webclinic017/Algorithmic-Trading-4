    <body>I'm at just over 50% with EHL, and keep waiting for a dip to buy in for more.  It's a reliable 1 or 2% a day kind of stock...just keeps on ticking up.  The price was very low this year for COVID, and because the company had managed to get itself into issues with debt.  Those issues are now resolved, and it still really looks like a cheap stock.

I will look at selling from $1.75 onwards, but for the time being this is definitely a buy, with lots of room yet to run.</body>

    <body>I've barely been on reddit in general, but I've bought more AVA and will continue to buy more - I've always said I'll buy more if my thesis is the same and the price is 60c or below and both seem to hold true.

Not sure why people continue to doubt me on this subreddit despite my stocks going up. I gain literally nothing from recommending others stocks which is partly why I've barely bothered to open reddit lately. As another user has pointed out in the daily thread, I was shit on for suggesting that UNI is a good buy, which I'm currently up 27% on. Buy AVA or don't, I couldn't care less.</body>
    <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="w-j1m" created="2021-01-13 14:24:06+10:00">
     <body>I don't think Ava is up though? and what you have to gain is an increase in buyers/holders, or at least additional exposure and awareness for the stocks you hold.

Proof or ban on your last Ava purchase, show us how committed you really are.</body>
     <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="AnonAnalyst" created="2021-01-13 15:05:18+10:00">

AVA isn't up, which is why I've bought more and will continue to buy more. I've included a screenshot of one of the parcels I bought that day, I bought another 5000 shares later on at 60c.

I genuinely don't think I have that sort of influence on people/the markets mate - people seem to disagree with me and doubt my stock picks (which is sort of what you're doing now). I've literally told others to sell CRO when I held (was waiting for the stock to come out of the trading halt to sell) and they've accused me of down ramping so that I could purchase more at a lower price, although I sold that dogshit stock at breakeven. 

I don't know what you're trying to prove. I give people my genuine opinion about stocks and I'm tired of arguing about them online, it wastes my time and gives me nothing. Like I've said, this is the exact reason why I've barely used reddit.</body>

       <body>I'm just a naturally skeptical person and since this is a public forum then expect to be challenged or called out on things you write, particularly if they're wrong or hypocritical.

      <body>Yeah I bought more at 59.6c a few weeks ago and I'm planning to buy more next week once I have the cash available.

I'm actually shocked that AVA has dipped this much despite no bad news - it's literally the same stock that it was since it hit 78c. I would suggest buying more and averaging down if you're investing long term.</body>

        <body>No clue man. I could tell you all about all of the undervalued stocks in the world but I have no clue about timing, which is why I'm a long investor. The quarterly report should be released within 2 weeks or so, that could dramatically impact the SP depending on how it goes. 

I trust management to perform as well as they have historically, so it should be good. As long as the quarterly is decent, we should see the SP shoot to at least 60c. No clue about how high it could go in the short term though.</body>

   <body>I have found stuff on the Simply Wall St site- it has a free page of "investing ideas" which you can filter by categories such as sector, undervalued, high growth etc.

Also if you look up a company on Market Index it has a small section on each page with links to tickers of "similar companies".

ASX website on each company page has a graph called "peer analysis" which positions sector/industry peers by PE.</body>

  <body>Afternoon buying action, classic Wednesday.

TI1, not so much atm. That's ok.

QPM on the up, ready to go. A whole lot of value here for cheap. Batteries are the future, and this is like the WOA of batteries.

Congrats to the IBX holders. I was *this* close to going hard into it when it dropped to 6c + 7c most recently. Kicking myself.

Edit: same for SYA, but at 2.1c this morning 😭😭</body>

  <body>Could I grab some thoughts and opinions on AVZ Minerals and Limited?

  
They have a huge 60% stake (with options for increased stake) in a project called the Manono lithium mine project (mining late 2021), with the largest deposit of high quality lithium found to date. I'm a geotechnical engineer (study soils and rocks all day), and looking over their borehole data, I found the geological model to be amazing. There's enough data points for a reduced risk in quantitative analysis of lithium. They also signed an offtake agreement for 5 years with GFL International, a subsidiary of China's largest lithium compound producer Ganfeng Lithium. 

Am I being blind-sided here by my love of rocks and the future towards EV cars? Any other holders?</body>
  <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="Drswing69" created="2021-01-13 13:06:24+10:00">
   <body>Also a holder - I think will be a future winner. Having the mine in DRC could be both beneficial &amp; detrimental (former: mine &amp; labour costs; latter: politics, not in-europe (hot spot for EV theme). Just my two cents. Obviously VUL getting so much attention due to it's perfect geographical location, tesla association, etc.</body>
   <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="timbuckley66" created="2021-01-13 14:43:10+10:00">
    <body>I know LI is one of the hot sectors but AVZ is in Africa so it's sort of a case of - if there is anything better sov risk wise, then the other stock is likely to win over. It is remote. It may be the biggest deposit in the universe but that doesn't mean much if it costs too much to get that product to the coast and shipped to the places that all Li will go to. It is years away from production and the company can bang on about how big the deposit is until the cows come home - Doesn't mean shit. Will it go up with every other Li maybe/hopeful/contender? - yes. Will it ever get to production and be anything other than a momentum trade in a hot sector? This is the payout question.</body>
    <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="Phishbaron" created="2021-01-13 14:52:39+10:00">
     <body>The other question is will the mining of lithium in the democratic republic of Congo be ethical in the sense will the miners be protected or will human rights be violated in an attempt to profit from poverty. The infrastructure should be looked at aswell as soon as I considered those two factors it was a big no for me

My other factor for lithium is its outlook. Which I see this as the similar boom that occurred around 2018 There appears to be plenty of lithium in more geographical accessible locations that don’t have to go through this sovereign risk.   And it appears to be a commodity that will be in a healthy surplus

Also the program requires railway establishment to be updated, increased road access, hydro electric plant refurbishment and much more. That’s a lot of capital to spend when the ports for shipping the product are miles away and banks plus institutions will have ethical guidance to avoid contributing to such a project. The only answer here for this issue is China which would love a foothold for any kind minerality in Africa.</body>
     <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="timbuckley66" created="2021-01-13 15:27:41+10:00">
      <body>Yeah I do agree - esp rail - lol - it's a jungle over there but HC zealots etc seem to think access to ports (um - what port??) is just chuck some track on the ground - ride that train - it's leaving the station - get on - toot, toot. Nah. Also, what country just fucked over a miner and took their assets and gave them to the Chinese? (oops - unconfirmed - under investigation last I heard). China will muscle their way into Africa over time most likely. Already are?</body>

   <body>Super bullish on this stock. Will be coming online to catch the 3rd Li wave. Looking to expand to 1.2Bil tonne resource. Current of 400mt @ 1.65% grades. Cleanest largest deposit by far. Sovereign risk might have been an issue years ago, but the Gov owning a minority stake in this says they will do their best to help this progress forward. AVZ owning 75% and looking to attain a larger stake.

Poeple are forgetting they also own the worlds 3rd largest Tin resource. With Tin @ $25000. a tonne, its already 700mil extra than they originally calculated in the DFS with rising prices.

1/3 of offtakes signed off, 2-3 more Li offtakes to come, 1 x sulphate offtake and a Tin offtake to come...alot of good news around the corner for this stock!! Holding 7 figure units...</body>

  <body>Generally, the market was strong today. Banks are pushing up against pre march 2020 resistance and do look to break higher over the med term. That would push XJO decisively out of current/recent sideways consolidation. Stay the fuck away from BBOZ etc would be one thing I would take away from this. The uncertainty of US implosion is almost over. 1 week to go? Li stocks were bought up on yesterdays dip. Next week is the biggie going by the XJO weekly. The news will inform the sheep soon and looking at that chart, that news will be along the lines of - 'Banks profitable, stimulus ongoing, vaccines working, US under control, yada yada'.

  <body>I got called out for not posting in a while so here's your monthly update:

&amp;#x200B;

**3DP:** No fucking idea what's going on with this stock so don't ask me. Just HODL guys, I'm sure it'll eventually (maybe?) rocket.

**AVA:** Going down for literally no reason, I bought more a few weeks ago and will buy some more this/next week. Only stock I currently recommend (UNI is good too but opportunity cost of not buying more AVA is a huge factor).

**UNI:** Well I don't think anyone really gives a shit but I bought UNI at $4.54 and apparently a lot of people are bullish of the retail industry for some reason (although we all need clothes...). Anyways, looks like it's paying off, currently up 28.6% over 2 months which I'm super happy with. The latest announcement is amazing considering the company has grown its EBIT by 61% + whilst having to shut down a significant portion of stores in Melbourne due to coronavirus. Extremely bullish of the company, I'm still going to buy more AVA instead of UNI though.</body>

   <body>I finally looked into to 3dp. I get the sense the it’s stuck in a holding pattern and that’s fine. I have no doubt after playing around with their tech it’ll go to well over 1billion market cap. Stocks like that provide plenty of opportunity to top up.</body>
   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="AnonAnalyst" created="2021-01-13 15:25:00+10:00">
    <body>I don't think it's an issue with the tech itself - moreso the company just needs more clients (maybe even marketing itself to more clients somehow?). From my observations the product itself is great and if demonstrations to the US army go well we should see the company do very well</body>

        <body>I'm not sure re buy tomorrow, but surely there's got to be a drop soon. Last news was December. 
Last week I was up to 230%, then fell to 190% before up to 300% today. There's volatility. 

I tried a cheeky T2 skim last week and almost lost 2k. If I'd done the same today, I'd be up 6k. 

So pick a drop this week perhaps?</body>

         <body>Nothing's guaranteed.
I bought PUR at $0.020. Watched it fall/rise 021 to 019 for a week. No annoucements so I decided to sell at .02 so that I could buy at .019 (extra 13,000 shares). 

That morning shoots up to 0.030 lol and has stayed above $0.030 since. I learnt a valuable lesson from that.😅🤦

EDIT 
I bought at 0.31 what I would have had, had I just stayed lol</body>

   <body>I'm at just over 50% with EHL, and keep waiting for a dip to buy in for more.  It's a reliable 1 or 2% a day kind of stock...just keeps on ticking up.  The price was very low this year for COVID, and because the company had managed to get itself into issues with debt.  Those issues are now resolved, and it still really looks like a cheap stock.

I will look at selling from $1.75 onwards, but for the time being this is definitely a buy, with lots of room yet to run.</body>

    <body>You still holding? Any ideas when PFS for Paradox project is due?

Was tossing up between NVX and ASN. Went with NVX as they seem to work with multiple suppliers for various products. Knew using logic was my downfall.

Huge potential for ASN with both Lithium here and ultra-high grade Uranium in the US. Probably jump in on the next dip.</body>

   <body>It's looking pretty cheap but yeah don't be like me and buy too soon! I think the only negative in their statement was that they had two months of stagnant sales due to covid... doesn't justify a huge 20+% drop.

I agree there is a timeline on oil and gas, eventually it'll die. But is that in 5-10-15 years? Who knows. 

Wherever it lands today is probably about where it'll sit for a while, depends if you think you can make more $$$ elsewhere.</body>

   <body>Last time I really looked at Myer there was an internal P&amp;L conflict I didn’t like. Don’t get me wrong, I’d never give them my money, but I did look.

What I saw was that they treated online sales as just another store code so basically online ‘competed’ with physical, who were competing with the each other. The politics and bullshit this causes is a deal breaker and shows they just don’t get it.

ADH and AX1 are better retail bets me thinks.</body>
