 https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/ketdvj/daily_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans_for/gg4n858?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

Ready to be patted on the back now. 60% day mfkrsss! Also, have a look at the depth chart. Means nothing now after market has closed but 13 sellers and 236 buyers... can't wait for monday!


AV1 - if you haven't heard of this before and you just gave the chart a quick eyeballing, you'd think maybe you've missed the boat. But fkn believe me, this is going to be huge. I bought at 11c, 12c, 12.5c, 14.5c, 17.5c and today at 20.5c. Largest holding for good reason.


9SP - not gonna say much on this one. Will just mention it from now until it has 10 bagged.


IHL - blardy waiting games. But green.


ESH - threatening the 1.7c close


CDT - flat</body>

   <body>https://mobile.twitter.com/9NewsGoldCoast/status/1346722658319298561

Saw this on the news the other day and my autistic brain started turning. E-bicycles are so hot they’re literally running out the door!

Bit of a Becky type play, but this trend does not discriminate gender, very 2021. 

I’ve done some research and am struggling to find a stock on the ASX (prefer to invest domestically) that gives me exposure to this market. 

Pedal Group (99 bikes) is owned partly by FLT. But you’d have to truely autistic to buy FLT for the sole purpose of gaining minute bike sales exposure. 

Vmoto (VMT) is not really the answer either. Its product range currently is restricted to e-mopeds/e-motorbikes.
I think these products are above and beyond what joe public is willing to go out and impulse buy. Whereas an e-bicycle on afterpay is now ‘cheap/affordable ’ and a recreational purchase, not just a transportation option. 

I’m heavy into lithium already so that angle is covered. 

Have you special geniuses got any suggestions as to how I can make trendies on what I see as a strong trend? Prefer ASX listed stocks. Will potentially purchase my first ever international stock if it is very compelling/relevant.</body>

    <body>Similar with "Kings" outdoor equipment. My wife's boyfriend and literally every other 4WD/Ute driver has the logo on their car somewhere, but the company isn't public :(

Agreed ebikes seem like a solid punt.</body>

    <body>E-bikes motors are dominated by imported Shimano and Bosch units. they also integrate very well with their own drivetrains. IMO it's basically a monopoly since so many big bike brands already use Shimano or Bosch. But happy to be corrected. Maybe there's some startups in China or something</body>

     <body>Thanks for the background. Looks like it would have to be more of a retail type play on the ASX via the BEX IPO as mentioned below. Will be keeping an eye out on how it performs when released to market in January.</body>

     <body>Appreciate your input, but not quite what I’m looking for. 

I see e-bicycles as a strong &amp; continuing consumption trend due to the following societal quirks/influences:

- inner city trendy

- keeping up with Jones’ in the suburbs (dick measuring item, like boats &amp; JetSkis)

- alternate eco-friendly transport to the office

- weekend recreational item

- fitness fad for lazy pricks (look like you’re getting fit without the effort)

- playground factor, all the kids at school have ‘bike x’. Parents now pressured to buy

- type of impulse buy that lines up perfectly with a personality that is irresponsible with Afterpay (e-bikes much more accessible using BNPL, perfect storm)

- electric anything is where consumption culture is going (electric cars etc.)

99 bikes, as an example, would be perfect if it was listed separately on the ASX.</body>

  <body>ANP - remember when I posted this 21 days ago?
 https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/ketdvj/daily_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans_for/gg4n858?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

Ready to be patted on the back now. 60% day mfkrsss! Also, have a look at the depth chart. Means nothing now after market has closed but 13 sellers and 236 buyers... can't wait for monday!


AV1 - if you haven't heard of this before and you just gave the chart a quick eyeballing, you'd think maybe you've missed the boat. But fkn believe me, this is going to be huge. I bought at 11c, 12c, 12.5c, 14.5c, 17.5c and today at 20.5c. Largest holding for good reason.


9SP - not gonna say much on this one. Will just mention it from now until it has 10 bagged.


IHL - blardy waiting games. But green.


ESH - threatening the 1.7c close


CDT - flat</body>

When all the nvx bagholders got burned on battery day, there was this unsung hero by the name of Tammy Talga, slanging rocks of natural graphite straight outta europe. Now Tammy Talga was getting absolutely no love after battery day; Tesla's in-house approach had completely turned people off of graphite. But that didn't stop Tammy from keeping it real and rallying to all time highs. Lithium game is lit.</body>

As an example, my story, bought into Z1P at ATH ($10+), eventually sold out at $6.50 just to jump into BRN at 87 cents.

If i miss out on the odd rocket, that’s fine, but trying to stick to my own rules and have a large margin of safety/ watching the SP for at least a month to see if it has any patterns or good entry points if i’m keen on it. otherwise you’re just blindly following the blind on here lol</body>

   <body>Upcoming catalysts:
acquiring a stake in an already producing asset anticipated no later than 31jan (pros - actual revenue, CFP asset. negs - could go belly up, potentially priced in)
points to note on this - oil price has skyrocketed since they announced it but the deal looks to still be going through. If it was CFP in november they're laughing now. Downside could be future exposure to oil. meh

next up is the big catalyst: drilling of the borba asset with $SGC (natural gas, unknown amount if any). 24% working interest in an area with massive supply issues and plenty of nearby infrastructure.

     <body>Great question. Few points - The DRC gov owns a 15% stake in the company, and is fully behind the project due to AVZ employing thousands of locals, and providing housing and services etc. They are keen to see this go ahead. Theres multiple transport options on the table and AVZ will send product both east and west on rail. (Glencore uses one of the rails). They own the 3rd largest deposit of tin in their stockpiles and will sell that off as credits, this will bring AISC to one of the lowest LI miners around. The "civil unrest" stigma is a thing of the past for the DRC!</body>

         <body>Thats down to valuing the resource and offtake agreements.

CXO - 9.6mt (resource upgrade on way) @ 1.4%li.
AVZ - 400mt (resource upgrade on way - projected 1.2Bil) @ 1.65%li.

CXO - 75kt Offtake.
AVZ - 165kt Offtake (1st of 4 offtakes and 1/3 of production).</body>

  <body>https://mobile.twitter.com/9NewsGoldCoast/status/1346722658319298561

Saw this on the news the other day and my autistic brain started turning. E-bicycles are so hot they’re literally running out the door!

Bit of a Becky type play, but this trend does not discriminate gender, very 2021. 

I’ve done some research and am struggling to find a stock on the ASX (prefer to invest domestically) that gives me exposure to this market. 

Pedal Group (99 bikes) is owned partly by FLT. But you’d have to truely autistic to buy FLT for the sole purpose of gaining minute bike sales exposure. 

Vmoto (VMT) is not really the answer either. Its product range currently is restricted to e-mopeds/e-motorbikes.
I think these products are above and beyond what joe public is willing to go out and impulse buy. Whereas an e-bicycle on afterpay is now ‘cheap/affordable ’ and a recreational purchase, not just a transportation option. 

I’m heavy into lithium already so that angle is covered. 

Have you special geniuses got any suggestions as to how I can make trendies on what I see as a strong trend? Prefer ASX listed stocks. Will potentially purchase my first ever international stock if it is very compelling/relevant.</body>

   <body>E-bikes motors are dominated by imported Shimano and Bosch units. they also integrate very well with their own drivetrains. IMO it's basically a monopoly since so many big bike brands already use Shimano or Bosch. But happy to be corrected. Maybe there's some startups in China or something</body>

    <body>Thanks for the background. Looks like it would have to be more of a retail type play on the ASX via the BEX IPO as mentioned below. Will be keeping an eye out on how it performs when released to market in January.</body>

    <body>Appreciate your input, but not quite what I’m looking for. 

I see e-bicycles as a strong &amp; continuing consumption trend due to the following societal quirks/influences:

- inner city trendy

- keeping up with Jones’ in the suburbs (dick measuring item, like boats &amp; JetSkis)

- alternate eco-friendly transport to the office

- weekend recreational item

- fitness fad for lazy pricks (look like you’re getting fit without the effort)

- playground factor, all the kids at school have ‘bike x’. Parents now pressured to buy

- type of impulse buy that lines up perfectly with a personality that is irresponsible with Afterpay (e-bikes much more accessible using BNPL, perfect storm)

- electric anything is where consumption culture is going (electric cars etc.)

99 bikes, as an example, would be perfect if it was listed separately on the ASX.</body>

  <body>AVA - you can pick some up for a good price with this volatility 

HT8 - currently showing as undervalued in Westpac / MorningStar ratings (fair value .20c). Super good quarterly announcement coming real soon which should rocket. You can pick some up for a good price with this volatility too.

CLT - undervalued and recently came back to earning good profits and revenue. Also a super good quarterly announcement is expected and should see this rocket back to its former glory. We might see some volatility though until it proves that these profits weren't a one off for this quarter. But still , you should be able to earn some good money by riding it. Personally I may hold through</body>

   <body>I got in on COB at ipo. Rode it up and all the way down. Bought some more at 16 cents. 
Cobalt I’m really bullish with a focus on cleaner energy being that cobalt is used in batteries that is used in jet turbines Electric vehicles etc. 

Cobalt supply is in tatters at the moment with most coming from DRC that use child labour

Chose COB because it is a pure play. Only cobalt. As opposed to the others. Thinking about buying come more tomorrow</body>

          <body>Reading through their annual report; 

&gt;the Company successfully raised A$40.3 million through a fully underwritten renounceable entitlement offer which allowed it to fully repay its corporate term debt balance on 30 June 2020.  

Also for those wondering, entitlements were issued at A$0.071 per share. 

Looking at their debt it appears that its mostly paid off. Just small things remaining. ( don't execute me I'm new to reading balance sheets )

Looking forward to seeing what comes from their low pH in-situ recovery operations. Quite bullish here but a newbie at best.</body>

   <body>Because its a low-carbon, zero emission energy source, lithium will be bigger but the US is still setting aside millions for a uranium stockpile and demand will outweigh supply in the next 2 years.</body>

Edit: Saw this quote and thought it was appropriate.

Clearly my timing is questionable (altho holding for 12mths minimum for CGT)
Time will tell on skill.  I back them to do the job though.
Aggressiveness not in question. I’m all in.

“There are three ingredients for success—aggressiveness, timing, and skill—and if you have enough aggressiveness at the right time, you don’t need that much skill.”
