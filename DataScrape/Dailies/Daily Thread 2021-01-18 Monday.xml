   <body>Long time stalker, sitting on $1000 to play with this week.

Typically long term safe investor, looking to have some fun.

Recommendations for purchases today?

Ex cyber sec person, TNT looks good, but I don't see potential in the company, or I'm missing something.

I don't own any lithium shares, so they would be an interesting place to start</body>

    <body>You seem to have a handle on it already. Invest in what you know. And remember that your job is to see potential that the market doesn’t.

As you said TNT doesnt seem to have major potential. There is an ETF in some shitty American companies. HACK, if you think the industry as a whole will be performing well.

There is a lot of FOMO money in lithium atm so be wary.

Personally I’m short term bullish on a lot of niche retail. But will sell out of them after the upcoming round of quarterlies.</body>

See me ride out of the sunset

On your brokerage screen

Spam the fuck out of daily threads

If you know what I mean

Wife to the left of me

And wife's boyfriend to the right

Ain't got no DD

Ain't got no life

(TNT) holding my bags tight

(TNT) leveraging my load

(TNT) watch my bags explode

I'm autistic, lean, and mighty unclean

I'm banned from ausfinance

T+2 coming for my knees

Tomsexx wants my ass

So load up your calls

Load up your stash

Load up your price

And FOMO for your life

Cyber wars coming to your town

China don't fuck around

   <body>It’s tempting to fomo into QPM but they have dogshit financials and even if their product was amazing (which I make no comment on as I don’t have a science background), they won’t be in a position to commercialise without a lot of capex which means a lot of dilution.</body>
   <comment ups="4" downs="0" author="mehungy136" created="2021-01-17 19:22:03+10:00">
    <body>Also, people keep saying they're green nickel. I'm pretty sure they produce literal green coloured nickel, not that their processes are environmentally friendly. People need to double check that shit. I saw some guy on Hot Copper derisively refer to their product as "macha powder" and not sure if it's the best quality. May require a tonne of refining and they need to ship in their ore from New Caledonia, so really can't see how they can be classified as environmentally friendly</body>

     <body>Pretty sure the nickel mines are part of why there's been riots in NC as well. Probs should hold the SP for a bit till the French arrive to kick some skulls.</body>
     <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="kervio" created="2021-01-17 22:08:38+10:00">
      <body>The mines are the entire reason for the protests, Vale are pulling out of their mine at Yate in the south and there's arguments about who will be buying it. A few mines around the country are currently blocked. The French always have plenty of gendarmes in New Cal, but no one will be kicking anyone's skulls - this is a country in a delicate political situation.

Stock will still fly tomorrow, I'm guessing... EV metals hype is strong.</body>

     <body>Well they rejected it in 2018, and so will likely reject independence again in 2020. Everyone saw what a clusterfuck Brexit is, so isolating themselves from France would be pretty stupid. 

As a result there should be no political effects on the NC resource that is supplying to the QPM refinery.

Furthermore Nickel exports make up a large chunk of New Caledonian exports, so there is no way they would give up that huge industry and economy. A large part of their workforce is there too. It's like if Australia suddenly stopped exporting Iron due to complaints.

I don't see any risks in that area at all.</body>

   <body>I’m watching TLG confused as fuck ever since regretfully selling near battery day. No shame in profit but coulda woulda shoulda. New shares being issued on the 27th though, could be a good opportunity for entry in the next 2 weeks. Considering selling something and jumping in long on it.</body>

    <body>I sold off pre battery day for some tendies along with nvx, brought back in later around the 1.00 mark and sold again at a minor loss. Like a damn fool. But agreed, hey. Didn't know new shares were being issued so TLG might trump everything else for a re-entry. It's not too late 😂</body>

    <body>Noob here. Does issuing new shares always mean the SP will drop? Is it generally a good or bad thing?</body>
    <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="check_meat" created="2021-01-18 07:53:35+10:00">
     <body>It's not a fast rule that the price will drop but when a company does a share purchase plan they give holders the opportunity to buy at a discount. Some holders will take the opportunity to sell then buy lower in the plan, putting more downward pressure on the price. So the SP may drift down.

Could be good if you're looking for an entry. Sometimes annoying if you're already holding. The reasons for the CR (survival, expansion, acquisition, pay off debt etc) would determine whether or not it's a good or bad thing. Sometimes the CR is for great reasons and people eagerly opt in, don't sell and the price stays pretty intact or moves up.</body>

There's also that thing with Sanyo, dunno whatever come of that. Talga however are big over in Europe and are pumping out that natural graphite which from my understanding is more sustainable in annode technology. Let's just say, I advocate for both companies.</body>

   <body>SHH has an iron ore mine in Tassie. They hibernated it in 2013 due to low iron ore price. The company is submitting a draft management plan to Tassie EPA soon to restart theproduction. Hopes to get the EPA approval before end of the year, then decide to restart the production if the iron ore price is worth it. Current price is double the production cost. Mine is ready to produce as soon as the decision is made as all infrastructures have been previously built.
Plus some others smaller projects and exploration.

  <body>Alright guys. Anyone who has not done their own research on QPM should NOT buy. 

Personally, I think it's a great stock. Sustainable nickel and cobalt processor, with offtakes to Samsung and LG. $1.5B NPV etc. 

But confidence only comes from doing your own research and cross-checking the facts and data, otherwise you will probably just end up panic selling on a 2% drop.

I'll see you all at $0.10. Tired of replying to some of the more ridiculous comments here.</body>

     <body>It's all good, I am assuming you heard of Tolga through that Stockhead article.

If you are new and just getting started in the market, honestly mate research, research and research some more. Commodities are a beast of their own and most of the stuff you will see spruiked here and elsewhere are all junior explorers.

Kumova is the real deal, but be aware that he is not right 100% of the time and he likely is in all of his stocks at much cheaper prices than what you are looking at. As for this sub, you are welcome to hop on whatever rocket ships are spruiked but be prepared to lose your shirt!

I would recommend just throwing a bit in to learn, try and genuinely learn why such stocks are being promoted and what the story is, you will learn your own strategy, red flags and green flags as you continue throughout the market. :)</body>

  <body>EMH - European metal holdings
I've been in VUL since 61c &amp; EMH from a similar entry, surprisingly it hasn't exploded like VUL (yet) 
Fully expecting EMH to follow the trajectory of VUL, has Czech government backing &amp; has recently commenced trading on Nasdaq. 

Its Cinovec project is the largest hard rock lithium deposit in Europe, the fourth largest non-brine deposit in the world and a globally significant tin resource. 

May be a nice one for those who missed VUL. 
In my opinion, a much safer investment then infinity (INF) lithium in Spain which has issues with local opposition to the mine development. EMH is Czech government backed &amp; partly government funded.</body>

   <body>They're the first company I did real research on before buying in at 1.191. Really unsure why they haven't taken off because they are significantly more de-risked than VUL and don't have the planning and funding issues VUL still hasn't addressed. Not to mention they're almost at DFS stage and given the government backing, they can hit production at the drop of a hat. fingers crossed for that rocket.</body>

  <body>Long time stalker, sitting on $1000 to play with this week.

Typically long term safe investor, looking to have some fun.

Recommendations for purchases today?

Ex cyber sec person, TNT looks good, but I don't see potential in the company, or I'm missing something.

I don't own any lithium shares, so they would be an interesting place to start</body>
  <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="hsjsksiaisnsbshsb" created="2021-01-18 08:40:33+10:00">
   <body>You seem to have a handle on it already. Invest in what you know. And remember that your job is to see potential that the market doesn’t.

As you said TNT doesnt seem to have major potential. There is an ETF in some shitty American companies. HACK, if you think the industry as a whole will be performing well.

There is a lot of FOMO money in lithium atm so be wary.

Personally I’m short term bullish on a lot of niche retail. But will sell out of them after the upcoming round of quarterlies.</body>

   <body>Minimal shares on issue, super low market cap - I think a lot of retail traders see 2.8c and don’t realise just how undervalued WCN is because they have no concept of market cap.

The delay of results is a blessing in disguise as it should coincide with the Biden $2k stimulus checks and Biden executive orders which should see gold surge.

  <body>Not wanting to throw too much cold water on the sudden surge of LKE enthusiasm, but am I mistaken in thinking their project: i) relies on as of yet unproven technology for direct lithium extraction, ii) has not been able to produce high purity results at scale and iii) will has the logistical handicap of producing from Argentina as EV production is looking decidedly intra-regional?  


Lithium is having a moment, sure. But the European market is the real prize, and geography + ESG credentials + scale seems to be the trifecta that has underscored VUL and EMN.. I don't see how LKE is riding those coat-tails</body>

   <body>A rising tide lifts all boats. Won't know which are the dogs till the tide goes out. A company only has to mention Lithium and the share price rockets. Of course the BOD of every dog shit company is gonna ride that shit. And every noob will read one of those announcements and think it is better than sliced bread.</body>

  <body>With pretty much every article/eDM/social meda post from insto investors, economists, stock pickers, brokers, etc. pointing towards 2021 being the year of EV's/lithium, Q1 is going to be wild. Dare-say buying opportunities are also going to be scarce. 

Could also be completely wrong. Either way, bring it on.🚀🚀🚀🚀</body>
