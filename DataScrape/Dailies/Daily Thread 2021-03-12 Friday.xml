   <body>So the ASX Sharemarket game is up, which is a thing my school is running where you can simulate investing with $50,000. The few winners take home a couple hundred bucks and it's statewide so some big competition.

[Here are the companies I can invest in.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kriifrux/comments/lu20jm/list_of_all_asx_school_sharemarket_game_companies/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Let me know which ones are your top picks are what prices I should set my limit orders at.

So far I'm probably going to buy:

* A2M if it starts looking more promising
* AIA
* BRG
* CCP
* FLT as soon as it dips
* KGN
* LYC
* SFR if it dips
* SYD
* TCL
* WEB as soon as it dips
* WPL
* Z1P as soon as the dump is done

I'm likely to just split my money between all of them equally, or potentially more in one if yall are bullish on it. These are just based on suggestions of what people recommended when I asked around a week ago or so. Let me know if I should change or add some, or if I should even make a poll.

Side note: I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. But since I won't be making any real losses, fire away with your suggestions.</body>

    <body>I find it hilarious how schools try to teach students about the sharemarket using that game. It teaches you the exact opposite lesson they'd want you to know. it goes for what? like 2 months? so how else are you gonna win without yeeting 10k+ into speccy penny stocks hoping it'll rocket.

When I did it at school, we were in the midst of the GFC, so everyone got fucked and all my mates are now scared of the stock market.</body>

    <body>Only buy the minimum number of shares if you want to win, I think I‚Äôve heard people say it‚Äôs 4? Of those you‚Äôve mentioned, LYC, KGN, FLT and Z1P would be my picks. You could either win convincingly or come dead last</body>

EDIT: What about Afterpay? They seem to be below their intrinsic value.</body>

   <body>A small pump for BRN. Recent weeks have seen the SP drop (below what I've paid mind you), I do honestly feel it's a good purchasing opportunity as selection for phase 2 or their SBIR program takes place on the 18th of March, NASA have had access to Brainchip's Akida chip and I feel pretty comfortable that it'll make selection for phase 2. As far an on the Edge AI goes Brainchip is currently in a league of it's own, but because we all have too much time on our hands, feel free to look into it for yourself. Also with tech stocks making a slight comeback that'll also work in BRN's favour.

1 sale worth 3.5m and 5 sales worth 1m each and lots of sales well over 500k.

   <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-03-11 20:32:57+10:00">
    <body>No I wouldn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs not my style. 

I also think people misunderstand what IOU does. They provide platform services to others. So in the BNPL space they provide their white labelplatform to others. They aren‚Äôt Afterpay in that sense - they are one layer away from consumer facing. That might be fine, but it also means that they are chasing a margin of a margin and the BNPL margins already seem so thin that no one (not even a giant like Afterpy) can make money out of it even with historically low interest rates. 

There‚Äôs a reason why credit cards charge interest, and why there‚Äôs a practical floor on how low the interest gets even if you shop around. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a lack of competition in the credit card space - so that‚Äôs an indicator of the true nature of what it takes to make money on mass consumer credit.</body>

          <body>By the end of March there should be a great ANN coming out, and there as per their timeline the next one should be 2-4 weeks after that. The technology is great and I think 40C's is a steal, however yes, no CGT does make it a pain, and for the future of the fund and serious investors I'd almost rather the CGT exemption not exist.

  <body>So the ASX Sharemarket game is up, which is a thing my school is running where you can simulate investing with $50,000. The few winners take home a couple hundred bucks and it's statewide so some big competition.

[Here are the companies I can invest in.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kriifrux/comments/lu20jm/list_of_all_asx_school_sharemarket_game_companies/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Let me know which ones are your top picks are what prices I should set my limit orders at.

So far I'm probably going to buy:

* A2M if it starts looking more promising
* AIA
* BRG
* CCP
* FLT as soon as it dips
* KGN
* LYC
* SFR if it dips
* SYD
* TCL
* WEB as soon as it dips
* WPL
* Z1P as soon as the dump is done

I'm likely to just split my money between all of them equally, or potentially more in one if yall are bullish on it. These are just based on suggestions of what people recommended when I asked around a week ago or so. Let me know if I should change or add some, or if I should even make a poll.

Side note: I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. But since I won't be making any real losses, fire away with your suggestions.</body>

   <body>I find it hilarious how schools try to teach students about the sharemarket using that game. It teaches you the exact opposite lesson they'd want you to know. it goes for what? like 2 months? so how else are you gonna win without yeeting 10k+ into speccy penny stocks hoping it'll rocket.

  <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="Mutated_Cunt" created="2021-03-11 20:02:46+10:00">
   <body>Fair enough.

My counter argument would be that PEN does not have any immediate obvious bad news, and that the market seems to have fully reacted to the last announcement now with us hovering around 0.1 

I think sentiment around Uranium is still shifting towards bullish, and the supply/demand thesis remains strong which will slowly rise the price of all Uranium miners, PEN included. I'm holding at ~30% loss on PEN right now but still remain hopeful, will probably downsize my overall position in PEN in favor of other miners if I get a good selling opportunity though.</body>

     <body>You're correct, Australia sits on the radioactive motherload of Uranium, but several states oppose the development of Uranium mines.

There's ~10 listed ASX Explorers/Miners of Uranium, I'll list a few players here with the mine location and stage

**DYL** - Developing mine in Namibia with other Namibian Explorations,

**PEN** - Developing mine in Wyoming USA, ASX_Bets favorite praying for Biden tendies but getting the CBT treatment lately

**LOT** - Own developed mine in Malawi

**BMN** - Developing a mine in Namibia

**VMY** - Explorer in NT and QLD, early stages

**PDN** - Own developed mine in Namibia, have two exploration sites in Australia and one in Canada

**BOE** - Own developed mine in SA, if you're looking for the Aus Uranium play, this could be the one</body>

  <body>A small pump for BRN. Recent weeks have seen the SP drop (below what I've paid mind you), I do honestly feel it's a good purchasing opportunity as selection for phase 2 or their SBIR program takes place on the 18th of March, NASA have had access to Brainchip's Akida chip and I feel pretty comfortable that it'll make selection for phase 2. As far an on the Edge AI goes Brainchip is currently in a league of it's own, but because we all have too much time on our hands, feel free to look into it for yourself. Also with tech stocks making a slight comeback that'll also work in BRN's favour.

BUT what would I know I'm just a random reddit guy.

    <body>Yeah this drives me crazy on this sub.

   <body>Sure, just make sure you‚Äôre not FOMOing into it. DW8 is very hyped right now and as with all heavily hyped stock, there will be a pullback.

I‚Äôm gonna throw some money into DW8 but waiting for it to recede from its ATH, possibly after the next announcement.</body>

    <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="Whiteknickers" created="2021-03-11 17:28:37+10:00">
     <body>It could go up until the next announcement.

But the likely hood that when the positive announcement comes, it will already be priced in since we kind of know what it‚Äôs going to be about.

The hype of that next announcement is contributing to what we see now in the SP increase. People will sell on the announcement, take profit and we will see a decent pull back. Hence the saying that gets thrown around a lot ‚ÄúBuy the hype, sell the news‚Äù.</body>

   <body>QPM would be my humble opinion. I'm not holding them either. Had a good look at them about a week ago but no free cash atm.</body>

    <body>I‚Äôm torn. I love both NC6 and QPM boards and products. QPM has nearly 5 million more on the sell side than the buy, so I might wait and see if the price pushes down a bit more.</body>

    <body>Think I‚Äôm gonna go for NC6 this week. Love NC6 and QPM boards and products but NC6 is in a bigger dip and has higher insider ownership. QPM has 5mil more on the sell side than the buy so potential to dip further, will wait and see if I can get in lower next week.</body>

  <body>Fingers crossed for LGP shares tomorrow. A bit strange there's 0 correspondence with successful investors before shares appear in account and go live for trading, there's probably some letter in the mail i'll get late next week.

Or perhaps i just missed out entirely lololol.</body>

  <body>Not sure if I‚Äôve seen this stock mentioned here lately but I‚Äôm looking at ASM.
They have signed a memorandum of understanding in Korea and are proposing a metal plant in the foreign investment zone. 
They plan to produce high purity neodymium iron boron powder and titanium powder. Manufacturing companies like LG chemical, Samsung SDI, SK Hynix and Hyundai are within close proximity of the proposed metal plant industrial area. 
The SP is $5.32 as of tonight so I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôve missed the boat and should have bought when it was a lot lower.
Anyone invested in this company?</body>

   <body>That was my first share I invested in. In at 90c's, out at around $2.50. They just keep delivering the goods, I wouldn't put anything past them. They sort of sat under the radar so over on Hot Copper you didn't get much up or downrampers, just true investors, it was a relief to see.</body>
