   <body>As always waiting for Neptune to bless NZS (im a cuck down -44% of a 15k investment 🤡🤡)

Bought AV1 at the first peak - and its just broken even again hoping for it to keep going

Have a 1k (smallest) investment in NVA since Nov and been watching it go sideways with a lead ball attached...

AVA better have a fukn wonderful 4c announcment - it was my cash cow but now its milking me. Im not worried im buy the dip if i free up cash - still crystal balling that it will hit $1 by May (b4 EOFY)

For the dude that got me on WBT in Nov last year... you single handedly keeping it from being an all red wash. Waiting for this to break the $3 and head on over to about $5 lol

4Ds just gotta keep going baby... you just broke even again... now to the mooooooon

lastly WHK im currently down 8% and think i just missed this horse. might sell it to buy the AVA dippy boiiiii

&amp;#x200B;

Sherlock Poo over n out

Good luck gents make bank</body>

   <body>The only issue I have with AVA is that it needs to get it's hands on recurring revenue. In saying that, it's a testament to itself that it can have 70% revenue growth in half a year off the back of 72% growth just last year. This stock is going to the moon. 🚀 🚀 🚀</body>

        <body>It's how many years of current year profits the company would need to return for you to cover the purchase of your shares. It's one way to help you value a company because you can see how expensive it is compared to the earnings. But depending on the kind of business you might be happy to buy in even with a large P/E.

For example:
If you were buying a bakery and the cost was 1 million dineros, and you know the bakery makes 100k dineros per year, then your P/E is 10. That's a good deal for a business that won't probably grow too much.

Then down the road there's a lithium mining eco weed selling electric car shop for sale for 5 million dineros and it's currently also making a profit of 100k dineros. Seems like a bad deal compared to the bakery at first glance, but in your autistic wisdom you get a feeling in your heart of hearts that weed smoking lithium EVs are going to 🚀 so maybe you buy this business instead in the hope that future profits will be higher, even though it has a P/E of 50 which is 5 times more expensive than the bakery.</body>

         <body>Makes sense, I guess this is why everyone is so bearish on BNPL companies since their market cap is so high yet they have negative net profit?</body>
         <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="kervio" created="2021-01-14 14:20:00+10:00" sentiment="HYPE 8">
          <body>Yeah, that's the thesis, but if those companies are only losing money because they are funding explosive growth then in a year or two profits can very quickly appear and justify the hype. It's growth vs value investing. Here on asx_bets most people are buying loss making companies hehe!

It really is gambling sometimes, but that doesn't automatically make it wrong 🤷‍♂️😬😎</body>

   <body>Seems like Japan and the US will be leading the charge globally for nuclear. Who would be the best positioned to supply each of those? Know PEN seem to be in a good position for the US but what about Japan?</body>
   <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="Calculated-Punt" created="2021-01-14 15:54:32+10:00">
    <body>I don't think Japan and US will be leading the charge, other countries like China, UAE, Asia and Canada have been the key growing players of late. But Japan is desperate to prevent widespread power losses and have announced will be assessing all nuclear reactors for quicker restarts. Australian based companies like Boss Energy and African miners such as LOT, and PDN will likely supply to Japan. Also DYL and BMN when their mines are built.

As for US. they are in a race to secure their own Uranium supply. Peninsula Energy (PEN) is an ASX company with a uranium mine and mill in Wyoming, USA. They also have a running contract book. PEN is my bet for US.

Vimy Resources (VMY) also listed on the OTCQB (us trading market) today to get more exposure over there.</body>

  <body>As always waiting for Neptune to bless NZS (im a cuck down -44% of a 15k investment 🤡🤡)

Bought AV1 at the first peak - and its just broken even again hoping for it to keep going

Have a 1k (smallest) investment in NVA since Nov and been watching it go sideways with a lead ball attached...

AVA better have a fukn wonderful 4c announcment - it was my cash cow but now its milking me. Im not worried im buy the dip if i free up cash - still crystal balling that it will hit $1 by May (b4 EOFY)

For the dude that got me on WBT in Nov last year... you single handedly keeping it from being an all red wash. Waiting for this to break the $3 and head on over to about $5 lol

4Ds just gotta keep going baby... you just broke even again... now to the mooooooon

lastly WHK im currently down 8% and think i just missed this horse. might sell it to buy the AVA dippy boiiiii

  <body>SO PNV is still doing heroin and sucking dicks behind the dumpster. Get it together PNV you are better then this... cheap though. 

ANP going well. I am holding strong on 100% profits and haven't free carried cause i think this has legs. 

I am now sitting on 51% total profit. Pretty motherfucking happy with that especially since i know its actually a bit higher then that. Why doesn't commsec have a total gains and loss bar?would be helpful.

EMN was a wild ride. Forgot to make a meme about it. 

IBX is looking great.

  <body>**AVA Gang** well done to everyone who bought the dip, hope you're all swimming in tendies. Good job to everyone else who holds, I'm pretty certain the stock should soar above 70c after the next report. Absolutely phenomenal announcement and the stock is still a decent buy imo.

 I will check again in about a month's time as to whether the stock is at a good enough price for me to buy, otherwise I'll start hoarding cash again.</body>
  <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="HyperIndian" created="2021-01-14 17:07:28+10:00">
   <body>Thanks again for being so adamant about AVA.

Question, why are you hoarding cash? You feeling bearish about the market in general?</body>
   <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="AnonAnalyst" created="2021-01-14 17:24:19+10:00">
    <body>That's alright, I just try to stand up for stocks I believe in (I have been wrong about some stocks in the past but for AVA there was no doubt in my mind which is why I bought the dip twice).

Technically I just spent most of my cash on the dip on AVA, but in general I don't think there are many opportunities currently in the market. I think that the market in general is overvalued and in turn there are a lot of overvalued stocks. This makes it hard to stick to my strategy of buying fundamentally sound companies cheap, so generally I hold more cash than most.

I also haven't really been keeping up with the markets over the past 6 weeks or so because I haven't really been bothered. This has meant I haven't looked into as many companies as I did previously (my last new stock was UNI back in November) but I can't really find anything new which has killed some of my motivation. 

I think 3DP is at a decent price, though it already makes up a sizeable portion of my portfolio and buying more would be a lot more risk than I'm willing to handle.</body>
    <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="Snoo38972" created="2021-01-14 17:46:06+10:00">
     <body>Thanks. I will have a look at 3DP and at loading up on more AVA.</body>

  <body>Had AVA on my "to buy" list for ages, I missed the initial rocket but still happy to buy in @ 60c with fundamentals that strong... I try and hold all my stuff for a year for CGT bs so should be fine

Salute/congrats to the rest of you who have had it in the \~50c range.</body>

  <body>**AVA Q:** Consensus around the end of last year seemed to be that AVA's logistics business ("Services") would be sold sometime in the next 6-12 months. [DMX Capital](https://www.dmxam.com.au/files/DMXCP%20September%202020%20Update%20to%20Investors.pdf) reckon it'd be sold for $50-60m  (before management take their performance cuts)   


Any ideas on what impact this will have on the SP? Is there any precedent? or is it just dependent on market sentiment ?   


Nb. Apparently AVA extended the management performance plan termination date to June 30, 2021 (from Feb 1, 2021), with a target EBITDA sale multiple of 9x to 12x</body>

   <body>4.97c EPS using EBITDA of $12mil as disclosed, divided by 241.38mil shares as disclosed on IRESS. (half-yearly)

at current price of 62c it's valued at 12.5x P/E (half-yearly)

IRESS data showing previous FY EPS 2.11c.

With more cash added to their bank account ($13.4mil now as disclosed in the latest announcement), the are unlikely to dilute shares with CR any time soon.

     <body>I stupidly followed the 5 to 7 idea and missed out on gains because of it. I am not saying I want 20 but I see nothing wrong with a bigger portfolio. 5 to 7 stocks sounds like good advice for boomers investing in stable large cap stocks where there are no rockets and most stocks increase at a similar rate.</body>

   <body>Almost doesnt matter.... commodity prices are surging, the energy sector is coming off a low base and the market is forward looking. Forsee strength in the sector for a quite some time.

I went the Beach (BPT) route instead a few months ago after extensive research (up 49%) both have done well however. Entire sector still well off precovid levels, upside vs downside risk metrics looked incredibly favourable when I bought a while back, still seems decent in the current moment although I haven't been adding to the position</body>

       <body>If everything is meant to pop once, wait until something pops, sell it and put it into something thatbhasnt popped yet but is most likely to. Then once that pops, sell and rinse and repeat until you have a handful left that are waiting to pop.

The thinking behind this is that things that pop, generally retrace. So instead of holding and losing gains, move the gains elsewhere.

Or better yet, don't listen to me cos I've no idea how to trade.</body>

     <body>Medical physicist with OSA here (intimate knowledge of the disorder). Their latest release about their OSA study is suspect. The literature on treating OSA with cannabinoids is flimsy at best. I can’t actually imagine how it would help, if anything, I would imagine (purely speculation) it would depress your respiration, which could lead to an increase in apnea events. I like the sound of their other trials and could see them being successful, but I would not be buying with the hopes that this will be positive or even useful. The fact that they speak so highly of this study and research direction raises a couple red flags for me. Full disclosure, I will likely pick some up in hopes of increased hype for their other studies.</body>

      <body>Check out the Carley Trial for OSA in the US, randomised Phase 2 human trial. Dronabinol met primary endpoint, but concerns of side effects.

Also RespireRX (USA) did a Phase 2 human trial with dronabinol and succeeded but ran out of funding to go to Phase 3.

IHL is using a novel synergistic drug, dronabinol + another ingredient. The primary endpoint is exactly the same as the Carley and RespireRX trials.

No brainer.... you look too deep into it. Clinical trials achieve success when their primary endpoints are met. There's a reason why OSA is the first trial of IHLs thats made it to the clinical stage.</body>

   <body>One I was researching for a couple of hours today was NUH. Looks very interesting. Just signed a 3 year contract with HP. They have been mentioned recently in Forbes and Time and won innovation awards.

Samsung attempted to buy them out a while ago but it fell through. So big brands really like the products that they are developing. One possibly negative thing I can see is a few upcoming capital raises to help them produce all these headphones for the large companies as they are still small.

The product itself is a major upgrade on the standard pap smear test for cervical cancer. The company mainly focusing on lower economic countries to increase the reliability and instant information for cancer. 

From IPO it went from the inital offering of 7 cents to 18 cents. 
Certainly one to look at</body>

  <body>Long time lurker, first time poster...

Incredible to see AVA bounce back - let the revival commence! Sitting at an average of 0.25 but sold a good portion a few weeks back to ride the lithium wave and to dip my toes into HT8.

Crystal Ball gazing right here, but is the sentiment for HT8 to yield something similar? Indicators suggest strong retail sales, in store and online, over the Christmas period, despite the covid scare? 

At a crossroad and feel like I should sell out of HT8 for AVA, or would it be worthwhile to see what results come about for HT8 (when are they expected?)</body>

Took a punt and switched teams and went from AVZ to ANP late in the day. Both looking quite good actually so I will probably jump back on at some stage. Just want to see where it’s going first and to be sure there won’t be an eventual selling of the news (which is probably unlikely with the late run in the day).</body>

  <body>Anyone invest in IPOs before they go to market? I’m seeing a lot of hype around for FLX and CHM. Scared of investing when they list in case they just explode on open. Wouldn’t have minded to be in beforehand if they 🚀 

Is it just a bad idea / too risky to invest in IPOs as a retail investor?</body>
  <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="WingsAndRuin001" created="2021-01-14 08:10:05+10:00">
   <body>Unfortunately a lot of IPOs aren't open to retail pre listing on the ASX. It's pretty straight forward for investing in the ones that are, but you need to be quick because they've been sooo popular it's ridiculous so 1) they close early and 2) you usually get heavily scaled back. So you can give them the minimum $2k, but you may only get $1k allocation but your money is tied up for 4-8 weeks. Some companies also only give refunds via cheque so you have to factor in cashing that to get the money back, and then yeah most IPOs give 10%+ on open I've noticed. So 10%+ every 4-8 weeks isn't bad! I just think 2k isn't enough when the scaling back can be huge and there is better opportunities in the small caps to make 10% in a week potentially. I think if you did 6k parcels it would be worth it, even with scaling back then.</body>

  <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="mehungy136" created="2021-01-14 08:48:19+10:00">
   <body>Not financial advice and take this as you will. VUL is great because they use MOTHERFUCKING VOLCANOES to process their lithium. But their lithium is brine so takes longer to get going and yields are generally lower, but low emissions is the future and companies are lapping them up to be able to say they source green batteries.

On the other hand, EMH is sitting on the largest hard rock (Mica) lithium source in all of Europe which is 49% owned by them and 51% owned by the Czech government. So that means they're already 51% funded at all times and can get going without needing to scrambling for cash. But the icing on the cake is that the Cinovec mine that EMH bases its operations around, is 200km from the upcoming Tesla gigafactory, a few hundred KM away from VW and Mercedes factories too. Having a massive lithium resource in your backyard is a massive plus for any company in being able to reduce transport costs, and brag about having low emission miles on their Li.  


Whatever choice you make, it's all super exciting.</body>

    <body>No, it's not going to happen. If the House sends the articles of impeachment to the senate it means that the Senate has to deal with those articles before doing anything else. which means they can't confirm Biden or his cabinet until the trial is finished. More than likely they'll impeach him now and the trial will happen 100 days after Biden is inaugurated.</body>

      <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="kervio" created="2021-01-14 13:32:39+10:00">
       <body>It's how many years of current year profits the company would need to return for you to cover the purchase of your shares. It's one way to help you value a company because you can see how expensive it is compared to the earnings. But depending on the kind of business you might be happy to buy in even with a large P/E.

For example:
If you were buying a bakery and the cost was 1 million dineros, and you know the bakery makes 100k dineros per year, then your P/E is 10. That's a good deal for a business that won't probably grow too much.

Then down the road there's a lithium mining eco weed selling electric car shop for sale for 5 million dineros and it's currently also making a profit of 100k dineros. Seems like a bad deal compared to the bakery at first glance, but in your autistic wisdom you get a feeling in your heart of hearts that weed smoking lithium EVs are going to 🚀 so maybe you buy this business instead in the hope that future profits will be higher, even though it has a P/E of 50 which is 5 times more expensive than the bakery.</body>

         <body>Yeah, that's the thesis, but if those companies are only losing money because they are funding explosive growth then in a year or two profits can very quickly appear and justify the hype. It's growth vs value investing. Here on asx_bets most people are buying loss making companies hehe!

10c and up for drilling announced.

No idea what it will be if they hit the gas they expect. 

Check out RLT as well if you like gas gambling. Helium concentrations possibly higher then anywhere else in the world.</body>

In the meantime I've bought some DOC as it looks like a good UK/AUS answer to TDOC, small amount only as a return to normal could see it get rekt.</body>
