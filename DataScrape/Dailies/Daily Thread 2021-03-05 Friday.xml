   <body>serious question time: I have an average buy in price of 9.9 on z1p, given the economy right now and the constant red dildo days I am thinking about cashing out tomorrow..the anxiety is killing me.

      <body>People and markets fear change, just like when the first lockdowns and shit happens it tanked and panic selling happened, now economy is going good and interest rates may rise so it‚Äôs a change and people once again panic but it all settles eventually. The economy is becoming stronger and that‚Äôs awesome it‚Äôs just a cycle that will eventually level out, if I was you and I truly believe in the company long term I‚Äôd try time the bottom and dollar average down but that‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôve held plenty of stocks that have halved and eventually return to normal and continue to go up. I guess it depends if you‚Äôd rather relocate that capital somewhere else with potential higher growth over the short term. Personally I stay away from BNPL I held IOU at .185 and it sat at 13c for ages and I got out at 23c and even though it‚Äôs higher now I couldn‚Äôt care less because it‚Äôs just too up and down for me. But my opinion is just one opinion</body>

If you still have faith in the sector, I'd pull out of Z1P and jump into IOU.

However, that's my opinion. Today I pulled out of Z1P and went hard into BPH, soooooo</body>

   <body>Planning on buying some EGR if the market turns around early on. was looking for a dip to get back in.
this company is going places with 2 factories in construction now and their share price is in a temporary dip in my opinion.

also looking at NVX for a t+2.  it's below my original buy in a month ago and sold for some profits but I reckon buy Friday sell Monday for some tendies

maybe it will go down a bit more but long term it's going to go up as they will be producing when the plants are up and running next year I guess.

I guess all indicators point to it being in a dip, maybe watch and see if it flattens out.</body>

  <body>Hello friends. I have found a way that I can finally make money from stonks. And the best part is, it will help you all. From now, if you each pay me $1.00 per week, I will tell you all what ticker I'm about to buy into, thus giving you a 10 minute window to sell off your shares in that company before I buy.  Given everything I touch turns to shit, you will be able to get out before I buy in and the share price plummets like a fat chick falling down a flight of stairs.

   <body>Yeah so he's *said* he supports gas but have you actually looked at the official plan? Not the 'leaked' one News/Murdoch keeps bringing up that talks about gas pipelines and penny farthings, I mean the actual plan. 

There is $0 dollars towards a gas pipeline, new gas developments, etc. The 'roadmap' is a fucking mud-map, it's literally just a list of ideas that happens to mention gas. The actual budget allocation is $1.9bil total, $1.62bil to ARENA and the rest assorted small projects, none of which are gas and only ~$50mil that coal companies can apply for. IE the recent APA &amp; AGL announcements about having to close plants due to being unable to secure funding? Yeah, $50mil isn't enough for all of them. They've been getting 3m delays on approval for a year now and have decided to cut their losses. Our government is finally caving to the scientists, economists, populace other countries, etc. It's just their PR team- Morrison &amp; Murdoch- are spinning the opposite. IDK why, but if they're saying one thing you should probably check because there is no punishment for lying in their positions. 

For more examples see the antivax sentiment in Murdoch news- he was among first non-trial patients to be vaccinated FYI. The whole bushfire fiasco. This rape allegation his office replied to last year but somehow no one had heard of... fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, a fooled man don't get fooled again.</body>

     <body>I generally agree with your sentiment but with this specific stock you are way off the mark. As fossil fuels go gas is the lesser of evils compared to coal, there has to be a transition period anyone who thinks we can go straight to renewables is clueless and the CCS is huge. There is potential to sequester upto 33% of Australias C02 emissions. 

On a socio economic level the fact we are here punting illustrates that we have some disposable  cash but for those who have literally nothing with kids, relatives to look after or the businesses that are within a bees dick of going under I‚Äôm sure the option in the short term (see transitional) is a welcome respite to have cheaper energy bills. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong we do need to push for renewables but in the short term I can‚Äôt see any other viable option without having to rely on fossil fuels</body>

If you're confident in your choice of stock and nothing had changed fundamentally, then sleep well at night and all this will pass. Dont be too caught up in the daily fluctuations.

The fed will buy however many bonds they need to get yields under control and once yields fall gold will catch a bid again.

I‚Äôve been loading up on miners recently, SLR, NCM, AMI, AUL/WRM. RMS also looked super strong last few days so will try to try to buy into that soonest chance I get.

   <body>Many car manufacturers have stated they'll be going all electric by the year xxxx. GM , VOLVO. 

A lot of stocks available for this play. EGR RNU TLG etc.  Probably a lot more but these are the ones I've looked into (graphite for lithium batteries / EV)

Edit to add:
I found that RNU currently has the most risk/reward ratio,  being a small market cap. But they've also dipped their toes into other things like gold (which is a bit of a turn off because they don't specialise in one thing). Surprisingly they held up real good and didn't get affected in today's bloodbath. Very speculative and volatile rn though. Its a bit pumpy dumpy and id approach with caution. If I was in the green and sitting on profits I'd take a punt on this. But because I'm in the red overall, I need to be more conservative and calculated moves.

EGR already has instos and they specifically are aiming for the EV market. They have a patent pending clean recycling program, "eco / green friendly" complies with EU regulations. Constructing first facility in Australia,  second in Germany. So it feels they are more established and have government backing too. Already listed in Germany and will list in the US. That's why I liked them the most. If you read through their last PDF brochure kinda thing,  it explains everything they're doing and planning and where they're at rn</body>

    <body>I‚Äôve seen those stocks mentioned a lot, I‚Äôm slowly looking more and more into them all as I get time. Trying to be somewhat selective in my process but still trying to leave no rock unturned so to speak. 

I believe for example these have great potential for the following reasons - 

VUL - aiming to be first carbon neutral lithium source 

LKE - pioneering cutting edge process to extract lithium at quicker rates and minimising water waste

NVX - leading battery tester supporting LKE to produce a high quality product 

PLL - Tesla deal and solid support</body>

    <body>I did the sums a while back on COB and I was super not impressed. I‚Äôll see if I can find it.

Edit:

Found it. 

A full feasibility study isn‚Äôt due until 2022, with just some lower scale pilot/demonstration plants in the meantime. That‚Äôs potentially quite a long time before this really takes off if ever. 

But more importantly. Page 16 of the 16 July 2020 announcement has what I‚Äôm looking for. This project looks quite marginal financially. 

Change the discount rate from 7.5 to 10 (entirely reasonable imo - 7.5 is low) and change the assumed cobalt price down slightly and all of a sudden the project is worth nothing. The current cobalt price is around $20/lb so even without changing the discount rate the NPV shifts close to zero at current cobalt prices. Probably a negative NPV currently using a discount rate of 10. 

The IRR is also way too low. Can‚Äôt see how it will ever get funding.</body>

  <body>Feel bad the most for BPH holders honestly. Who would of thought that a simple sentence from Scomos mouth would crush the stock. 

To be fair, in Australia things have to pass senate and they're not decided by 1 man like in the USA (Trump executive orders and so on). Well I think so anyway. So there might be some hope depending on who gets donations and what deals are made. But yeah understandably the stock would crash like it did from what he said.

He should've answered in a different way. Like "thats something were still discussing". 

On the flip side, it should of been apart of the DD , that this project is subject to approval or whatever and the risk priced in. Like with XST/SGC , we knew the risks. I dont think people knew of this.</body>

   <body>It's hard to compare the crash of XST/SGC to that of BPH.

The risks for XST/SGC have not changed. Gas = $$, no gas = no $$. That has always been the case as even a lesser amount of gas would still bring about an sp increase. People hyping up the report were to blame for the huge dump.

What SCUMO did actually increased the risk of investing into BPH. Now there's a real chance BPH won't even get a crack at gas.

But yes, at the end of the day, you are right we should all know the risks before we invest.</body>

   <body>Super suss government. They vocally support gas projects, but cut/delay funding to them until companies are forced to abandon them. They state they'll fund XYZ project (gas pipeline etc) but then have rolling 3m approvals- anyone who's gotten Centrelink will know how long those will take lol.

Meanwhile huge private capital, huge government funding &amp; huge ACT interest in greentech over same time period. Seems like they're pulling the ol` switcheroo to me. Saying "hey guys gas is totally the future lol ur grandad was right" while furiously dumping gas assets &amp; cranking money into (the stuff every other country has been investing in for last 5-10yrs). Shouldn't really be surprised, writing has been on the wall for a long time. Latest WA leadership is at least honest about it, but bludging billions into gas would have been a fucking robbery-seriously, invest as much money into the stop-gap as the end goal would cost? Corrupt as fuck if they did. Not sure how to feel about it overall. Obviously lying is bad, but the follow through would have been even worse.</body>

   <body>Any thoughts on why they're booming? Is it because it's coming into summer,  local travel,  things opening up there with vaccine roll-out? 

What types of venues does ALG have compared to those US based ones you mentioned?</body>
   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="noobinvestin" created="2021-03-04 18:12:00+10:00">
    <body>Many others and I believe there is currently plenty of pent-up demand for travel and entertainment at this current point in time.

Furthermore, due to reduced expenses, household savings rate has increased too, allowing for higher entertainment expenditure in a post-vaccine environment. For reference, ALG pre-covid peaked at $1.63 in January and now it is $0.60.

ALG owns theme parks and US entertainment venues (bowling, food etc.) Anyways, I'd advise reading their annual report.</body>

  <comment ups="6" downs="0" author="Bigjohnthug" created="2021-03-04 18:58:33+10:00">
   <body>IMO TLG won't go anywhere without huge insto interest. I haven't done a detailed dive on their assets etc but from a quick comparison to other greentech companies; they have like $5mil AUD cash &amp; need $1bil USD just to complete ONE project- the Niska mine/anode refinery project. They also burn ~$12m a year.

The Smedvig family (Norways Ellison's / Rineharts) sold out completely in January. 9% of the company. Pallinghurst pulled a director in August, after paying $10m to appoint two. They've since invested elsewhere, although they hold ~3% still through Pelmer SA. Mark Creasy still around, but he's small-fry by comparison.

The narrative seems to be that they need over $1bil just to do ONE project, which is- from what smarter people have told me- nowhere near enough to complete that one project. They have lost their biggest benefactor &amp; another has gone hands-off instead of helping them get that funding. Goldman owns a tiny bit, but they got given it for free so doesn't count. Mark Thompson seems like a cool dude, but not sure if he'll be able to secure that much money + get the relevant approvals etc in Sweden, when he lives in Perth. Very big payout if he manages to, but better chance would be Aussie company in Aus or Swedish company in Sweden IMO.</body>

    <body>Thats some impressive DD that would benefit a lot of people who are looking into TLG / graphite or already bought TLG.

I would love to hear your thoughts on EGR.

From what I understand, we have $54mill+ in the bank, enough to complete phase 1 construction of its Australian battery anode purification facility. Phase one will allow 5000 tonnes per annum production,  but they plan to expand it in the future to 20,000 tonnes per annum. They also plan to open a second plant in Germany (these things will come in time,  with possibly more funding when needed. Whether thats from future CR or from profits from the initial facility we don't know). 

But current funds are enough to complete the Australian facility , and to me it seems like they're in a very good position,  right place at the right time.

I found the best material to learn what they're doing and what they're all about from the "Investor Presentation and Business Update" announcement on the 12/02/21

Edit: here is a link to the announcement im referring to https://www.ecograf.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2175604.pdf</body>
    <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="Bigjohnthug" created="2021-03-04 20:14:19+10:00">
     <body>I like EGR a lot. Was in ~$0.35-$0.4 but sold when it hit $0.970 within a couple days- lucky timing but figured it was a bit too quick. Now back in at $0.665, if it stays low long enough I'll stock up anywhere below $0.650.

They have a decent cash balance, a good relationship with WA gov &amp; ARENA- grants from both IIRC. Facility is politically important, due to independence (geopolitics) &amp; job creation. Their other projects have gotten significant interest- German one especially. The instos who bought in have sold some, but it's only ~10% of their holdings for 2-3 companies- again from memory. Given they had an instant 50% premium,  not selling more is a strong signal IMO.

They cover 2/3 of the basic green principles- reuse &amp; recycle. Also cost effective, clean graphite if scaled, with a lot of potential markets to enter into. Given inroads into EU already &amp; US listing soon, seems like the best pick to me.

Also interested in NVX, but riskier from what I see. MNS similar to TLG- lots of potential, little proof. CXL &amp; RFX I just don't understand yet. HZR is cool, also at the actualization stage, but again, don't understand it enough yet.</body>

    <body>I agree with your general sentiment and share some of those concerns, particularly around the smedvig divestment and lack of any official word on why. 

A note on the numbers though. Current cash &gt;$30m after recent CR. The first project is Vittangi (Niska is a downstream project for 2025+) and the PFS had initial capex US$27m and stage 2 US$147m, which is much more achievable and poses significantly less risk than going straight to a $1bn capex project. A DFS is due this month so we‚Äôll learn more then. Really need some binding offtakes to de-risk it. 

If Vittangi works out then securing funding for a  future $1bn project will be easier than from a standing start. The link-up with Swedish state-owned iron ore miner (and neighbor) [LKAB](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LKAB) is promising in reducing sovereign risk, currently non-binding though so if/when it becomes a formal agreement that will represent another very significant de-risking for me. I see the company location in Europe (mine in Sweden, production in Germany, R&amp;D in Cambridge) as a huge benefit - on the doorstep of a major market with the political will to make real change in this space. Talga are also looking for cornerstone investors and appear to be close to formalising something - I‚Äôm not usually a fan of this approach due to the dilution and loss of control, but it would appear to be the best option in this case and will be done on a project basis, not the company. 

So significant risks of never getting started remain, but if they do there‚Äôs the potential to be a business 10x or more the current market cap. I‚Äôve put the chance of succeeding at &gt;30% so it‚Äôs a +ev bet for me.</body>

A Beginner Trader Who's Eyes Are Burnt Red

Hi everyone, 

I'm a beginner trader and my first month of trading is off to a rocky start, as to be expected...right?

I've learnt that when someone makes money, someone else loses, and I'm sick of being the one who looses. I can recognise simple stock indicators, like volume, EPS, profits, debts and most financial indicators on a balance sheet etc. But the more I learn, I realise the less I know. And the picture of an amateur trader like me getting chewed up and spat out in the big trading world becomes ever more clear. 

I realised I need an edge, I need to be smarter, make better predictions...I'm hungry for more. As trading amongst young people like me becomes more popular, I see opportunity. Opportunity to rob clueless little fish just like me, to become the shark, and pave my sweet road to riches. But I'm still the little fish, but hey...At least I know that right?  

So with a basic knowledge of shares and the stock market, what direction would you point someone like me to analyse a company, and the market as a whole, to find a good investment?  And I'm not talking about what someone finds on the first page of Google when they search "How to find a good stonk." I'm talking more detail, more in-depth, above the average person's analysis...work I can be confident in. Regardless if they're short, mid or long term analysis, if they work (even ones that don't) I want to hear 'em!

   <body>I've been doing this a few years. I still know next to nothing. People who have been in the stock market six months know alot I don't.

What I do know is buying a stock you believe in and holding that for a good six months let it blow up.

CNBC is a good tool to see what is happening in the US with certain sectors. Generally if travel stocks go up in the US it happens the next day in Australia.
Sometimes it doesn't and you can get burnt lol.</body>

I truly believe in the business but can't sit by when I'm certain it's going to continue to tank as long as this bond yeild bullshit is happening. im seeing a clear rotation out of speci techs to blue chips.

     <body>People and markets fear change, just like when the first lockdowns and shit happens it tanked and panic selling happened, now economy is going good and interest rates may rise so it‚Äôs a change and people once again panic but it all settles eventually. The economy is becoming stronger and that‚Äôs awesome it‚Äôs just a cycle that will eventually level out, if I was you and I truly believe in the company long term I‚Äôd try time the bottom and dollar average down but that‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôve held plenty of stocks that have halved and eventually return to normal and continue to go up. I guess it depends if you‚Äôd rather relocate that capital somewhere else with potential higher growth over the short term. Personally I stay away from BNPL I held IOU at .185 and it sat at 13c for ages and I got out at 23c and even though it‚Äôs higher now I couldn‚Äôt care less because it‚Äôs just too up and down for me.

If you still have faith in the sector, I'd pull out of Z1P and jump into IOU.
