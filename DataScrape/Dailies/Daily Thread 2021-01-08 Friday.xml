   <body>It feels like 1921 all over again. Easy money, stonks only go up, can't go wrong, all innnn!!

Be careful dropping one stock to chase another. Every where you look, it is easy to find a stock doing better. That is just a sign of a bull market. Looking at a stock moving today and feeling like you missed the train is easy to do when trading emotionally. Knowing that most good stocks and many shit stocks will rise in this environment should allow most people to make some decent returns. Buy the dips and have rock solid stops to get out of dog shit. Making bad calls is part of the game and cutting losers that break supports should be no big deal - riding the good calls will make up for those losses in short time in a bull market.</body>

   <body>Company - XSTATE RESOURCES | ASX:XST

Current price - $0.006

Market Cap - $10.86M

Mining explorer company drilling for gas with Sacgasco in the Sacramento Basin. Drilling expected to begin in late January (quick gains to be made).

California has a shortage of gas - current drilling location has easy access to the California market which is paying a premium for gas. Estimated resource from geological analysis is said to be between 10-16TCF of gas (a lot more than Strike Energy and Warrego's WE3 drill) - so a lot of upside if results come in.

My play on this stock is about incoming price catalysts, then taking a pussy position in freecarry approx 50% into drilling.

Short term price catalysts include:

1. Resource estimate by an independent party

2. Further funding by a third party (speculated) to derisk each companies liability potential

3. Spud date announcement

Drilling: 

4. 28 days of drilling with 10 seperate gas zones.

Obviously the sky's the limit if it hits gas (highly likely - quality is of question) and I believe there wouldn't be as much downside if the drill fails at these price levels.

Short term target for myself is $0.011-0.012 (1 bagger) before spudding based on price movements on STX, CVN and 88E. There's been a lot of volume these past two weeks - generally moving up 0.001 and solidifying that position for a week.</body>

   <body>My HT8 boys , just want to give you some advice for announcement day (in regards to selling vs holding, and what to do):

There's a big sell wall at .22c. There's 2 things that can happen:

1) we rally up to .22 but we don't break that wall. If this happens, we will either hover around .20 - .215 , until the wall breaks , or , until people panic sell back down to the .18c mark again (if we could see into the future and knew this was going to happen, it'd be smart to sell at .215 and then buy back in at the dip at .18c)

2) we break the .22c wall and we hit 30c . If this happens , we won't be seeing the SP under 25c again (if it goes up to 30c after we sold at .215 , were going to be really upset, and won't be able to buy back in for cheaper than what we sold our parcels for).

We have to monitor closely on the day and make our choice on the day. I absolutely have faith in HT8 , so im not scared about losing my money long term (if I could fast forward my life 6 months id be certain HT8 would have tendies waiting for me to collect). Its just whether you want to swing trade with it to potentially make more money than just holding (sometimes this can backfire, or it can work in your favour. Its pretty much luck)

Be prepared to make your decision on the day. Check the buy and sell orders volume, etc. And don't stress too much. Good Stonks only go up , eventually.</body>

    <body>Sounds like a guesstimated plan based on TA?
Any other reasons it will go to 30c other than TA? If revenue and profit from the quarterly report justifies the price range it will definitely stay above where you claim it will be. Hope they've made some good sales figures over the holidays because you seem to be obsessively anticipating their quarterly like I do for AVA</body>

I can't complain about FMG - it has risen 50%+ in a few weeks and pushed my balance way up. If it drops to $24 I will add more. The divs are 20% return at current share price. Iron ore pricing may see FMG remain at current levels or higher for some time. If the world goes on an infrastructure binge, then commodity super cycle meme.

  <body>verrry bullish on PUR. they’re mining in a very good place. 

hopped on to RMX just to see what happens with the upcoming announcement

good to see dw8 starting to move again. looking forward to the christmas period revenue whenever that comes out 

fuck z1p

fuck apt

PLY continues to be un-memed, much to my surprise. almost topped up at yesterday’s pullback but was too up the fanny of spec mining stocks


picked up EMN today since I missed out on VUL</body>

   <body>We seem to be on a very similar trend here kinky.  I bought RMX at .009 and after you mentioned PUR the other day, I did some research and hopped on at .029.  Very happy with both so far.  Also have MAN (similar opportunity to PUR) and MHC.  Its the year of the small miners!  


Edit: I'm also a Z1p holder - just got to ride this one out.  After capital raise I reckon rocket boosters will go on :)</body>

Possibilities for me are - markets are pumped up, retail is all in, pull the rug out next week. - markets are being pumped, retail is all in, flick it back and forth for more brokerage than the world has ever seen. - markets are pumped, retail is all in, but you ain't seen nothin yet.

I haven't checked XJO/XAO's close today, we were about to touch ATH, wonder if big money is making a final push towards preCovid ATH, and reap the profit once it's crossed.

I literally didn't check anything for the past 3 weeks since I went on a holiday to regional aus and had no internet

airbnb description said internet was provided at the house, we got there and it has no internet and only people with telstra has 1 bar signal. called the host who sounded a bit annoyed we called him and he said the description shouldn't be there. my mate basically called him a retard and to take down the description. description is still there today.

     <body>Quick look at the board of directors doesn't really excite me, they're lacking medical experience in key positions and seem to have installed a couple of people with medical experience as non executive directors for good looks. The tip may be based off the resspitory hype from last year and it's IPOd pretty high, I'd track that one for a couple years until there's more public information available.

Ofcourse that was just from a quick look, big name partnerships and sales could deem my view invalid.</body>

  <body>SPQ is going to be up today based on depth. They announced 19% more gold than predicted in their drilling results and the market still hasn’t reacted. On the dl they have put in land acquisition request in locations that suggest gold deposits may be even larger. 

While uranium is going to be a bull market and I’m looking for input on the best pick, gold is also shaping up to be bullish so this is my return of favour.</body>

  <body>Total noob question incoming...

In my Commsec account the value for the total profit/loss keeps changing because I’m selling and buying, so it’s not calculating profit that has been sold off and reinvested. This is pissing me off. 

How do you guys track the profit/loss over time if your strategy involves doing quicker trades along with holding?</body>

   <body>Yes it may be oversold. But are you happy with SP sitting here for several weeks or slowly going down? Its entirely possible. Next catalyst is earnings report in Feb. May still be months until there is an uptick in sales due to big tech clients reducing their capital allocation to data heavy projects. And then that will take time to reflect in the earnings. I have it in my watchlist and will buy in on signs of a reversal/shift in sentiment</body>

  <body>My HT8 boys , just want to give you some advice for announcement day (in regards to selling vs holding, and what to do):

There's a big sell wall at .22c. There's 2 things that can happen:

1) we rally up to .22 but we don't break that wall. If this happens, we will either hover around .20 - .215 , until the wall breaks , or , until people panic sell back down to the .18c mark again (if we could see into the future and knew this was going to happen, it'd be smart to sell at .215 and then buy back in at the dip at .18c)

2) we break the .22c wall and we hit 30c . If this happens , we won't be seeing the SP under 25c again (if it goes up to 30c after we sold at .215 , were going to be really upset, and won't be able to buy back in for cheaper than what we sold our parcels for).

We have to monitor closely on the day and make our choice on the day. I absolutely have faith in HT8 , so im not scared about losing my money long term (if I could fast forward my life 6 months id be certain HT8 would have tendies waiting for me to collect). Its just whether you want to swing trade with it to potentially make more money than just holding (sometimes this can backfire, or it can work in your favour. Its pretty much luck)

Be prepared to make your decision on the day. Check the buy and sell orders volume, etc. And don't stress too much. Good Stonks only go up , eventually.</body>
  <comment ups="16" downs="0" author="overdose_on_Telfast" created="2021-01-08 00:24:19+10:00">
   <body>Sounds like a guesstimated plan based on TA?
Any other reasons it will go to 30c other than TA? If revenue and profit from the quarterly report justifies the price range it will definitely stay above where you claim it will be. Hope they've made some good sales figures over the holidays because you seem to be obsessively anticipating their quarterly like I do for AVA</body>

  <body>EMH had a decent bump today. crucial to note that they have a 49% ownership of the Cinovec lithium/ Tin project in Czechia which is 250km away from the proposed Tesla gigafactory near Berlin. Their CEO recently hinted that they "may or may not" be in negotiations with "many battery manufacturers" in the region "but can't disclose specific names" wink wink, but then went on to say how Tesla has a priority to reduce overall emissions on batteries produced. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself but I'm getting little jitters just thinking about the potential of this partnership.

   <body>I think STX is good long term. Basically the gas pressure was too much and they need higher rated equipment, so they'll just cap and come back. I'm reading it as a great sign. The problem is it just extends the time frame out to completion which is also costly. I think its possible they can hit 50c this year still. But really i know next to nothing about gas or drilling so DYOR. I'll be holding atleast 12 months more i think.</body>
