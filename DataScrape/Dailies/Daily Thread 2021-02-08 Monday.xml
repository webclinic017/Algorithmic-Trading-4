    <comment ups="13" downs="0" author="blamblamthejamjam" created="2021-02-08 15:37:42+10:00">
     <body>I can't tell you that with 100% certainty.

I can tell you that there are two catalysts that could massively re-rate XST in the very near term.

The independent resource report which will give an objective opinion on how much gas and shit Borba holds is due to be released like within the next week if not in the next few days. The 3D seismic imaging appears to show fackin yuge amounts of gas, which should be confirmed by the resource report.

What makes XST such a strong prospect in my opinion is that while speculation is that Borba could hold anywhere from 1Tcf to 14Tcf of gas, even 200Bcf or 0.2Tcf of gas would values XST at over 100m market cap. Current market cap as of 10am this morning was 21m. So on a very conservative estimate, XST should be worth about 5 times it's current valuation.

Further, Borba is due to be drilled in the next couple of weeks. There's already infrastructure in place to export the gas to a huge and hugely undersupplied Californian market. Production could start in the next few months.

To be honest I have no idea how XST has flown under the radar so long, it should be valued at many multiples it's current price. Because of that I feel quite comfortable to put most of my portfolio on this bad boy</body>

  <body>My top trades for Monday morning:

MNS - hearing the placement was oversubscribed 4-5x, if you can get them anywhere near the placement price you should do well!

LKE - their OTC entity traded at 34c equivalent over night, we should see LKE match that on Monday. 

MXC - after glow of LSE dual listing announcement, strong finish on Friday, should continue to bounce on Monday.

DYOR - good luck all!</body>

 <comment ups="29" downs="0" author="ASisko" created="2021-02-08 02:22:03+10:00">
  <body>Today I scraped all the ASX listed companies 20M-2000M and filtered for price momentum over a series of recent intervals (more intervals that beat the market the better), then added a filter for recent google trends topic momentum, and I also added last week's ASX Bot comment mentions (courtesy u/DareBottle. Unfortunately the bot hasn't been able to update this week). 

The aim of this exercise was to pick stocks for a small "retard momentum" fund I'm planning to run within my portfolio. I'll be paper trading it only this week because I'm already bagholding LKE with last week's play.

At that point I had a shortlist of about 10 companies (ADO, LGP, EGR, ECS, INR, PEN, CXL, RCW, VUL, HZR). Only 3 were on last week's ASX Bot list but I gave a point to HZR as well because its been mentioned this weekend. I went and pulled the outstanding buy/sell order data from commsec for them, which I used to create some histograms showing where the interest on both sides lay and the overall buy/sell split. This step was important because even if the buy/sell ratio is high, it is no good if all the buy orders are sitting at massive discounts to last price.

Anyway, after all that I have LGP, EGR, CXL, RCW and HZR left in the race awaiting Monday AM price action to determine the (paper) pick to hold for the week. At this point **LGP** looks most likely, especially given the 'cannabis shortage' news that did the rounds on Saturday. I think I'll need to find an efficient way to add some sort of news/narrative filter going forward, possibly with google trends.


By the way CXL has no search trend data and no reddit mentions, but it made the list on strength of momentum alone and a great buy/sell scatter. I'll be looking into as a potential longer term play and would be interested if anyone else has come across it.</body>

  <body>Said I'd spend the weekend hunting through the bargain bins for any xxs junior lith miners that were less then $20M.  No luck.  Closest was PNN at $20.4M  MC

Before I start - full disclosure, I'm holding : VUL, LKE, PLL, INF, EGR, EMN

So decided to start looking outside just the miners....and a bit broader for battery and EV tech - the mandated push to EVs is a once a generation movement...so trying to cover all bases.

In order of preference at the moment....LIT - love their recycling program - battery material recycling hasn't been prioritised or solved yet - given govts are pushing zero carbon, this seems a no brainer

MNS - Gigafactory approved in QLD, State Govt Support, supposedly producing in New York by year end - value end of the chain

Rare Earths - Havent done anywhere near enough reading - but might be time to move across there - there are a few xxs juniors in that field.  RMX @ $20M MC - real speccy, REE $50M MC - love their spiel but not the fact they're locking in to China

Notable mentions:

HWK - just want to wait for it to drop back a bit

LRS - I was almost there Friday....but lost my interest a bit on the weekend - around since 2010 and after the iron ore boom , theyve done nothing for 7 years

&lt;Edit&gt;  Forgot to add AGY - Lith Pilot plant operational - so cash on the way, great second site location in the US next to Albermale when they decide to get that up and running

25Hours until open and counting...</body>

   <body>With RE miners keep in mind only 1 made it from explorer to Producer in the last 10 years so really do your research mate,  it's a very technical field.
I'm in the same boat with you on REE so having Shenghe onboard is a bit suss.</body>

  <body>Big week for Z1P management. If they can secure a big name American investor, you can sure bet they will rocket.

   <body>Even if it doesn’t mate it’ll shoot above $10 in no time. A big portion of people here will hold Z1P to their graves, as will I and a few of my other mates who have tried it out and love the concept. This was Apple and APT sounded like at the start.</body>
   <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="AdohamHicoln" created="2021-02-07 23:51:29+10:00">
    <body>They aren't aiming for $10. No real investor is aiming for just $10. If they get an investor we are looking upwards of $40 at least. And that's me being conservative. The catalyst for APT share price was the 5% Tencent Stake that put them on the map for foreign investors. Hoping for the same with Z1P.</body>

  <body>man i’m so keen for tomorrow. 

LRS Z1P LTR in particular I feel will do well tomorrow 

IHL had good news last week with in-vivo results looking great. hopefully the SP catches up as it’s been stuck at 16-17 cents for a couple months now. 

TMZ looked to be on the up after good results but the silver hype (or more the hype death) might blunt it


will be watching some of the tickers mentioned ITT and see if I can pull off some momentum trades this week

  <body>XST looking like it's gonna go for an afternoon run again - currently up 16%

Don't forget, news catalysts likely coming up this week are:
- resource estimates (possibly between 10-16tcf of gas)
- spudding confirmation for next week
- rig mobilisation 

Still very cheap if it's set to go on a BPH run up to $120M+ market cap!!

200M shares trade today and Friday - solid base now at 0.012+13c.

Very easy money to be made this week I reckon

  <body>XST and TMR. Expecting news for both hopefully. Ive mentioned tmr a few times but nobody seems to be picking up on it.

There is an oppurtunity to buy into a gold miner with assays due for visible gold. It has a mill on site so minimal capital required to produce. It has a tiny MC. 22mil. JORC due as early as march. Could 4-5 bag easily in the next 2 months. No stop loss needed here for me.

XST - more shares hitting market tomorrow. resource assessment due. drill date soon. still heavily undervalued with massive potential to rocket. I have a tight stop loss because I'm a coward with a low risk tolerance.

Remember cowards like me:

  <body>If you're looking for something that hasn't already launched to the moon yet, you would be in under the wire to find out about **MNB**.

21 year life of mine, incredible impact of investment to improve the quality of life and food security of Africans. DFS will reveal project economics but immediately it's apparent there's 6-10 bags of upside between now and production with low risk of show-stopping roadblocks.

Asia uses 100kg/ha fertiliser on agricultural lands. Africa uses 3kg/ha, and there is no fertilizer production in middle africa. The market for this company is enormous. The proposed plant can even be tailored to provide micro-nutrients to what the population needs.

[https://youtu.be/If6-p\_RuSFI?t=106](https://youtu.be/If6-p_RuSFI?t=106) if you would like to find out more, as discussed at the Africa Down Under 2020 conference. Just chuck it on 1.5x speed. Honestly it's an incredible vision that has taken a lot of time to develop through agronomic trials. They are tailoring the fertilizer to be a blend exactly what the region needs.</body>

  <body>AV1 having a good run today.  But zooming out on the graph and it's just back to where it hit in early December 2020 after the notice of regal's investment and the exercise of options.  What's changed since then? - arguably not much, except the 4c have the strong hint of big contracts as did the deezer announcement last week.  (Big) future revenue priced in? I think probably not.  (And it's still under the Jan 2020 high)

So i think there's still plenty of opportunity and will buy more this week if I can.</body>

     <body>Honestly, from what I heard about LKE and then with my further research...it's the real deal. Plus the second it makes it to $1 it becomes more attractive to the public as somthing other then a penny stock. 

This is a serious long hold for me. I'm talking 5 years and up. Do I need to hold that long to make profit? Nah I'm almost at a bag already. But barring any potential company fuckups even ( looking at you CAN you fuckers) I'm in this for the long haul. Same with AV1 

When I bought LKE some people told me to wait for 15c. I didn't, I got in at 26, it dropped, I averaged down, it dropped again, I averaged down again. It never made it to 15c and here I am.</body>

   <body>Not at all - but the people who bought at $10 last time probably wished they had bought at $6.

The chart is extremely overbought since the price has doubled in the last 3 weeks. It’s quite common after such a move for the price to fall back 20-50% of the rally. If you miss the move then don’t chase, wait for short term profit takers to sell then when long term buyers move in again you start buying then. Goes against buy high and sell low but you end up making more money.</body>

  <body>Why do I never see Cobalt discussed as much as Lithium? Cobalt is an essential part of batteries, there’s actually more cobalt than lithium in a lithium-ion battery. And the top 3 producers of Cobalt are the Congo, Russia, and Australia. We’re primed to dominate the market</body>

   <body>G’day mate. 

Bevan Slatts made me a lot of money with the NXT IPO so I would be reticent to bet against him. 

Also one of the issues with micro caps is obtaining borrow. Even if you can get your hands on some, the interest cost would likely render it difficult to justify the position.</body>
