EMN - bought almost at a high
FEX - finally doin sumthing... i guess
NVA - no love from market
TLG - one stock i believe in the most but share price take one step forward then two backward
WCN - fail gold spec buy
XST - dont need to talk about it
LRS - only green in my red ; pls release results</body>

    <body>Down 28% on EMN and 14% down on TLG so I feel you. Gonna diamond hands though because it's just a matter of time before they rocket. EMN is the ONLY manganese supply in Europe and TLG is the ONLY natural graphene supply in Europe. Both have DFS coming out later this year and both have government backing. Patience and diamond hands</body>

  <body>I think my trading strategy is best described as "WW1 trench warfare"... I've sent multiple waves of my available cash reserves into no man's land, only to have the market mow it down. I've had some gains, but it seems to be coming at a mounting cost and winter is setting in. 

My only solution is to send more over the top. God speed into that dark and terrible night cash reserves.</body>

   <body>Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect.</body>

    <body>A key pillar of my strategy is that if I send enough cash in it will break the will of the market. The savagery of my cash will intimidate the enemy troops, they will route, breaking back across their lines, and my stocks will run unhindered across the battlefield pillaging every tendie village and city on the road to Bearlin.

Your only hope of getting in now is a subscription to the Motley Fool and a resolute commitment to buy every stock they reccomend no matter how retarded it is and then immediately panic sell it at a loss. Also you must listen to every past episode of their awful podcast where they tell you about the stuff that's already happened many days prior and answer yet another question from a retard listener asking "should I trade stocks?" to which they answer "maybe, but this is general advice only".</body>

  <body>Here’s Tom with the weather for today.

Thanks Trish, as you can see with the headwinds from the US indices we’re looking at a red storm with a high chance of paperhands hitting the ASX. Punters should avoid looking at their portfolios and instead slip into a self-induced coma till Monday. T2 traders are unfortunately caught in a sudden downturn. Settlements are still due though, cunts. Cough up the cash. That’s all for the weather. Good luck, autists.

(Let it be a green miracle when I wake up please)</body>

  <body>I originally sprouted XST however made the decision to take 95% of holdings off the table. Not a fan of the report at all similarly to the markets reaction. Here's why:


- Low amount of estimated gas. Firstly, doesn't make sense how the predecessor drill had a higher estimate when the 3D's look so much more promising for Borba. 


- Low amount distributed between 11-16 stacked targets with chance of success sitting at around 17% for the high majority of sections. At the same time, sprouting a potential 141 BCF assuming you hit commercial gas in all sections is highly unlikely (probability already against you). Thus hitting at least one target with a 70% COS may not even be economically worth it.


- Same day director transactions instilled a very low sentiment in me and the chance of this drill coming good.


- If this drill is to be a foundation for creating a future Borba trend and further unlocking this multi TCF potential, then future cap raises + dilution of an existing 2.6B shares on issue will be nasty. However, if the oil pumps do breach into previous economical/lucrative levels, this may be mitigated.


- My suggestion to keen holders through the drilling campaign would be to jump ship to SGC who will see higher upside on success if (especially low) gas estimates are found.


Lastly, please don't trust those on HotCopper who say that ""ohhh $5 gas prices x 38BCF = $190M market cap or 7.3c". Try figure out the NPV of the project and coming to your own conclusion. You may be surprised when you realise the market cap may already be close to this figure. Conversely, if the results are good, then you can expect a slight premium in share price as the surrounding tenements will become more valuable.


Ultimately, I am a bitch, however, this is far too high risk with little reward for me. Good luck to all you diamond hands, praying for some good tendies for ya and a good drilling campaign ❤️</body>

   <body>This is solid advice. I sold out of XST today at 0.016 while I still had a profit. I actually do think there’s still some potential but, after the only ‘okay’ report, the now smaller potential pay off didn’t justify the level of risk I had invested at all.

Also yeah, SGC is definitely the better play if anyone still wants to punt on this. I might buy back in tomorrow for a small slice in anticipation of nexts weeks results.</body>

  <body>A lot of talk about if LRS will match ADN’s quality, let’s say it does and the stars align and they end up with 10x the area ADN had and the possibility of 2 more strike zones to drill. It’s expected they could match the market cap of 600mil approx based on those results alone. They also have gold coming up, lithium and copper all coming online end of the year. If they’re sitting at a 600m MC just after the white powder am I too far fetched assuming they could easily reach 1-2 billion MC if all other minerals have good results? I have researched LRS a lot so I am fairly in tune with expectation management and I am pretty invested with 1 million shares at 60k but just want others opinions on where this bad boy could go after everything is up and running?</body>

   <body>If (big if) this resource meets the hype, it’s still 4-5+ years away from commercialization. There’s no way it gets anywhere near a 600m market cap on halloysite alone any time in the next couple of years. ADN is less than a year away from mining and will have big first mover advantage, by which time it can build up a big cumulative advantage. 

LRS still has years of orphan stage to go though after this initial discovery hype. I think people are getting a bit carried away and a few will be burnt.</body>

   <body>IOU is saying it's going to target South Korea in the future. Well, South Korea has the world's highest levels of credit card debt. When I lived there it was an average of US $70K credit card debt, which is absolutely insane. The thing is that over there, the chaebol run about 80% of the entire economy and those 5 chaebol own the banks that give out the credit card debt. Those 5 big corporations (Hyundai, Samsung, LG, SK, Lotte) are not going to let little IOU end their credit control. The chaebol keep the South Korean people in perpetual credit card debt so as to 'milk them for life'. 

The IOU plans to enter that market are going to crash and burn because IOU doesn't have the billions required to fight the chaebol's control.

If IOU wasn't pursuing this stupid avenue, I'd say it's a buy. 

Afterpay shouldn't have bought Empat Kali in Indonesia either- that's going to blow up in their face big time. **There's just this stupid bnpl rush into new territories without much thought atm**.</body>

  <body>Has been a bad week for me (and last week) somehow i manage to baghold all the underperforming stocks. Just looking for a compatriot who share my experience. You know get some emotional support haha.

CXO - buy the dip they said average down they said lol. Did that last two weeks
EMN - bought almost at a high
FEX - finally doin sumthing... i guess
NVA - no love from market
TLG - one stock i believe in the most but share price take one step forward then two backward
WCN - fail gold spec buy
XST - dont need to talk about it
LRS - only green in my red ; pls release results</body>

   <body>Down 28% on EMN and 14% down on TLG so I feel you. Gonna diamond hands though because it's just a matter of time before they rocket. EMN is the ONLY manganese supply in Europe and TLG is the ONLY natural graphene supply in Europe. Both have DFS coming out later this year and both have government backing.

    <body>I think the idea is to make it more accessible to teams that hope to make it to the big leagues but aren't there yet. Mobile i think will be a catalyst for revenue, the subscription model will probably act like a ps/xbox/gym subscription and make 70% of the money off inactive people.

Mobile esports is picking up in SEA, not sure if it will get to the CS, Dota2, LoL and Overwatch level, but we only need a fraction of a bees dick in that market to have exponential growth.</body>

  <body>Someone/s manipulating SHG harder than I've ever seen before. Buying/selling &lt;10 units at a time at $0.460 to keep SP up. Still very keen on them long term but gonna wait this out, see where dust settles and reenter from a better point. Suck that -30% but oh well.

A close second is my boy CTE, with so few sellers it's very easy to manipulate I guess. Gaps down on sub-50k volume, ~100-200k volume in between as the B/S ratio flips. One order yesterday wiped ~25% of sell side, closed only 14% up but not that surprised given was a good profit opp with shallow depth. Only 4.2k units, 80k between $0.25-$0.275. Last decent sized sell was $0.300 down to $0.265. Won't dump this one but will probs have to average down.

Going to do my DD on which greentech to buy next. Short term euphoria over oil/gas is bullshit IMO. By the time these guys get drilling it won't even matter because it will be 5-10yrs away &amp; oil isn't going to stay near highs that long. Saudis going from reducing to increasing production by 1mil barrels/day =glut of supply. EGR, HZR, TLG, NVX &amp; a couple others been getting sold down to move capital, prices starting to look decent for reentry. EGR close to $0.65 is good med/long term, the rest not as sure on. Big gas is still getting dumped- Origin, APA and AGL. Massive volume sells too.

Also HZR downrampers: they're NOT 'blue' hydrogen, the methane is from wastewater treatment. It's either going into capture, the atmosphere or into a useful process for materials/energy. Literally the definition of a GreenTech, it covers reuse &amp; recycle. Only way they could improve is if they started a 'reduce' program and started smacking politicians around for talking about coal. Fucking Barnaby.

Lastly SWF vs RZI? SWF is a real broker, RZI has a much better (but very parasitic) profit model. Monthly fees+forced rebalancing = two strong streams. They cap BTC ownership @ 5%, but don't pay people the difference during this run from what I see. Will spend weekend scrubbing their anns/statements/T&amp;Cs to figure it out but my current guess is it becomes an 'equal' stake in whatever ETF they wanna sell, while the excess BTC is essentially cash in hand for them.

On that note, was a bit depressed about wiping last weeks gains then some this week, before I remembered my $400 investment into BTC early 2019. Literally forgot for 2yrs. Solid investment strategy.</body>

  <body>EMH is officially the most bipolar stock on the ASX, every second day I'm up like 20% and then the next day it's down 15%, then up again. This morning I checked it was up 15%, then by close, it was down 10%. If I had the time and patience to micromanage I'd make a bomb off just daily fluctuations. What a nightmare</body>

  <body>So JAT on Friday is starting its Trade with China regarding baby formula which is a pretty big move. They’re currently 0.35c per share so still time to get in. They’re currently up 25% but is looking to rocket as tomorrow will be the official day. 

This is a investment stock to hold at least until the first QE. 

Disclaimer: I own shares in JAT.

Bought back in at 15c still thinking I was a legend. 
Dropped to 12c now, so finally went retard haha

But I think it's a great stock, good fundamentals, high grades, solid management and solid location.

I'm in long-term, just planning on selling and buying back when I feel it's overbought.</body>

The price keeps going down because everyone is waiting for an update of the permit BUT assuming it's approved, they're sitting on 9.6 bcf of helium. 3 prospects across the Lyon Formation are indicating their is a giant reservoir that is easily accessible beneath them. Not just that but they're planning on drilling 3-5 wells. 

For comparison DME (Canadian competitor) has 1 well and their sp is 1.51CAD with a 84 million MC. BNL's SP is 0.03AUD at the moment with a 40 million MC.

   <body>FIN- but its a shell doing minimal to stay listed 6-mil market cap have found some semi massive sulphides awaiting some assays. cores look more copper bearing than nickel. Twitter cunts come back to it every now again and it gets hyped so you can accumulate on the dumps from failed trend trades.

AZS- just had an oversell on results looks promising but 109 mil market cap.

BSX- is the dream Vietnam project but not really a bagger from here.

ADD- got a mate spruiking it, he talks to much shit but 18mil market cap.

Gotta ask why nickel right now? i figured with the rise in nickel price the Chinese would off load stock piled pig iron nickel while the price was higher causing a dip in spot. Also Indonesia might be opening back up it's supply soon?
