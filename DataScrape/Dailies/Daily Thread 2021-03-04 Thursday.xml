   <body>Great day with the VML, BRK and IXR trifecta. Took some profit and did some portfolio rebalancing and went on a shopping spree.

PLL &amp; RAC - broke almost every rule I have for myself buying these two. FOMO and YOLO wins in the end.

TNT, AVA, NVA - all look reasonably cheap to me. If not at the bottom, must be close to it.

4DS, IBX - don‚Äôt love these 2 as much as I did a few months ago but still like their story and look to be getting back in at a pretty good price.

CRO - not sure if I‚Äôm having a blonde moment here but currently 10% cheaper than recent CR price of 9c?? ü§î

SRK - 3rd time lucky. Will probably just hold this now unless it breaks support. Please don‚Äôt.

PEN - feels like I‚Äôve been missing out on all the fun so bought my way into the PEN15 gang. Lubed up and ready to go.

VMS - one of my first babies, sitting at it‚Äôs CR price and theoretical bottom of 5.5c (recent low was 5.2c). Cashed up and then some. Not long until the wet screen plant is complete and first shipment.

A1G - an out and out gamble. Very curious spike and candle yesterday. Got my seat at the table, interested to see where it goes.

Feels like I‚Äôve now got the ASX_Bets starter pack, albeit a year late.</body>

     <body>Yes and no. I‚Äôm a bit of a hybrid swing trader/investor. Generally buy the swing lows and sell the highs, keep some skin in the game, so essentially free carrying a lot of the stuff I hold.

I only buy stuff I think is ready to be bought, not buying for the sake of buying (except with RAC and PLL lol).

It‚Äôs not for everyone but it forces me to take profit and helps reduce downside risk.</body>

    <body>SRK is testing my patience, but I have ultimate faith in this one.

If you look closely into the ownership structure of the top shareholders (follow the rabbit hole) you will get a sense for what they‚Äôre trying to do here and how to ultimately extract true shareholder value...(hint - it‚Äôs not pip trading it!)

This is truely the only penny stock in my portfolio that I would be completely comfortable to close my eyes on and check it in 12 months time. And I never say that!!</body>

     <body>I haven‚Äôt looked into them in depth but your bullishness was what got me first interested. Did some digging and their story checks out. 

Undoubtedly a good long term play but I hate seeing red haha. I follow the ‚Äòkeep your losses small‚Äô mantra so get myself out sometimes when I probably don‚Äôt need to. Has worked for me to date (more than it hasn‚Äôt I hope) but have no issues getting back into stocks and this was one I was always getting back into; SHE another but unfortunately it ran today ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</body>

      <body>Yep, I‚Äôm sure they will do another CR pre-production to raise the capex for mine start. 

I‚Äôm obviously hoping they do it at a much higher level than where they‚Äôre currently sitting, and also they only need $15m to get up a cashflowing...so minimal dilution.

It ran pretty hard from their last raise of $4m at 10c, so they have track record of doing things tightüëå</body>

     <body>I think the next couple days will see IXR establish value a fair bit higher than here. Going into a TH for announcement (rather than just releasing) caught a few T+2 traders off guard and they needed to bail today. 

IXR has never been a meme/rocket share, simply because it‚Äôs the real deal! Watch it over the next 3-4weeks, and I think your 7c target will look way too cheap üòâ</body>

  <body>I spoke to my bank teller today. Early 40's I think, Male. I went in to start on applying for a loan to buy a block of land coz all the mexicans have moved up here and bought nearly everything for sale in the last 6 months. He asked how much I had and why it's not all in cash in my account earning 0.1% interest. I told him it's all in the stockmarket. He asked if I had heard of GME:US!! Should have seen the look on his face when I told him I traded it twice for profit and gave what I made on the 2nd trade away to some rando on the net. Fuck I live for this shit. Told him I don't usually YOLO full retard but GME was free money and most of my cash is in FMG. The chick next to him wet herself. When I left, the entire branch looked like it was in a huddle.

   <body>Had my order in for a top up on IHL at .19 but got unlucky didn't go through.

Lots of ifs and buts BUT, I think Av1 needs time as they are still in the early stages of making real money. They have an actual product and once companies are over the 'freemium' stage and become real customers (assuming they like what they see), we will see the SP actually move. An announcement about a partnership with google (soon) is on the cards too so that will be a good boost too.</body>

  <body>Great day with the VML, BRK and IXR trifecta. Took some profit and did some portfolio rebalancing and went on a shopping spree.

PLL &amp; RAC - broke almost every rule I have for myself buying these two. FOMO and YOLO wins in the end.

TNT, AVA, NVA - all look reasonably cheap to me. If not at the bottom, must be close to it.

4DS, IBX - don‚Äôt love these 2 as much as I did a few months ago but still like their story and look to be getting back in at a pretty good price.

CRO - not sure if I‚Äôm having a blonde moment here but currently 10% cheaper than recent CR price of 9c?? ü§î

SRK - 3rd time lucky. Will probably just hold this now unless it breaks support. Please don‚Äôt.

PEN - feels like I‚Äôve been missing out on all the fun so bought my way into the PEN15 gang. Lubed up and ready to go.

VMS - one of my first babies, sitting at it‚Äôs CR price and theoretical bottom of 5.5c (recent low was 5.2c). Cashed up and then some. Not long until the wet screen plant is complete and first shipment.

A1G - an out and out gamble. Very curious spike and candle yesterday. Got my seat at the table, interested to see where it goes.

Feels like I‚Äôve now got the ASX_Bets starter pack, albeit a year late.</body>

    <body>Yes and no. I‚Äôm a bit of a hybrid swing trader/investor. Generally buy the swing lows and sell the highs, keep some skin in the game, so essentially free carrying a lot of the stuff I hold.

I only buy stuff I think is ready to be bought, not buying for the sake of buying (except with RAC and PLL lol).

It‚Äôs not for everyone but it forces me to take profit and helps reduce downside risk.</body>

If you look closely into the ownership structure of the top shareholders (follow the rabbit hole) you will get a sense for what they‚Äôre trying to do here and how to ultimately extract true shareholder value...(hint - it‚Äôs not pip trading it!)

     <body>Yep, I‚Äôm sure they will do another CR pre-production to raise the capex for mine start. 

I‚Äôm obviously hoping they do it at a much higher level than where they‚Äôre currently sitting, and also they only need $15m to get up a cashflowing...so minimal dilution.

It ran pretty hard from their last raise of $4m at 10c, so they have track record of doing things tightüëå</body>

    <body>I think the next couple days will see IXR establish value a fair bit higher than here. Going into a TH for announcement (rather than just releasing) caught a few T+2 traders off guard and they needed to bail today. 

IXR has never been a meme/rocket share, simply because it‚Äôs the real deal! Watch it over the next 3-4weeks, and I think your 7c target will look way too cheap üòâ</body>

  <body>My ASX\_Bets portfolio result today: -$1,271.45 (-3.72%). Green: LRS, RAC, WWG, Z1P. Red: IOU, IBG, LKE.  LKE, my heaviest investment ($16k), held the fort yesterday, sank the portfolio today with  -$1,025.88.  
Overall, still confident with the portfolio for a hold till Easter (LKE minimum 8-12 months, they seem poised for a slow but steady advance).  
 IBG is the only stock I bought purely based on rockets seen in posts (for the rest I did click on links people provided in comments and looked at the company websites - what a deep DD, I know). Is IBG good for a long hold?  
Any other changes you guys recommend? Next window for change I've given myself is after Easter, not touching portfolio till then.  
Good luck for tomorrow everyone!</body>

   <body>IBG was chuzwuzzled?

It's been doing nice this week, it was overall green for me today, but the final drop back to 0% for the day puts it $56 under for me. 

My portfolio looks quite alright. Exactly half red and green. LRS has become green parity of XST (my heaviest, 8k), up and down 2.5k respectively. Most other things are less than $80 in red, with the exception of LGP which had me down 500. BPH used to keep that balanced but as of today BPH has dropped back to my buy in price.

Most stocks have hopefully near term announcements, though honestly I have no idea what's going on with LGP</body>

    <body>no real DD, did get sent a write up from a friend saying the company will have a huge market in producing products for Electric vehicles and green energy. Stock is only really in a Stage 1 start up, hoping that the mines they've found could hold up over time but could easily turn south.

  <body>I'll probably get shot for saying this but I'm liking pilbara minerals. Has a good support at $1 and obviously they produce and sell lithium.

Another stock I like is CIA they are a iron ore producer. Have a very strong balance sheet.

   <body>Pick SLR over all the other goldies except maybe NST. I owned SLR from 97c to $2 something when gold was rising. I think they have had their day but are oversold at current levels. Recent highs will be hard to see again unless gold can get above $2k/oz.</body>

  <body>So I cancelled a couple of good for day sell orders at 4:05 or something in commsex and they got status of 'pending cancel' as expected and holdings appeared back in portfolio. 

Checked again now and the share qty has doubled...both actually in profit too so screenshotted as doubt I'll ever get there legitimately.

This happened to anyone else? Is it likely to resolve itself overnight or I am going to waste 40 minutes of tomorrow morning on the phone?</body>
