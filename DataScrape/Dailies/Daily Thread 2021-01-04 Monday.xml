   <body>MEG and BSX, upcoming drill results due anyday, will be buying more tomorrow of each. 

KGN if it crosses vwap tomorrow, cooked it on my call on Thursday as l got cocky and didn't look at TA. 

VRX could get interesting this week. At all time highs and fundamentals are awesome.

FYI - huge broker upgrade on target share price. Nice Volume late last week.

CRO - for a tick. 

Also watching Uranium players. This sector might trend in 2021</body>

    <body>I sold my kgn without a loss.

It was an annoying stock to hold. But it could have some good movement.

I'm not sure why ruslan kogan sold 115m worth of his shares. Makes me distrust him but it's such a good company.</body>

   <body>CTE is going to be my purchase this week I think. P/E ratio of 12 for a small cap is juicy, and I like their potential still to be involved in some way in cryogenic storage for the vaccine rollout... and even if they aren't, the shit just keeps rising to all time highs anyway. 

May also grab me some AVA</body>

   <body>Sold the last my rookie stocks picks PPS for 35% profit, I think the uptrend is over. Now my portfolio is full of potential buy and hold 10 baggers.

BUD
NVA
FLN

9SP for the swing play. 

The next chapter has begun, taking it to the max in 2021. Next up for potential 10 baggers, iron ore, JMS, DD incoming.</body>

   <body>HT8 director bought $100k worth of shares on market (@ 0.185) last trading day (announcement was released after market closed). Expect a surge on open, as always the case when directors buy on market. I feel like something is cooking, as there's a lot of confidence from the directors over the last few weeks. Maybe a super 4c report coming. Very exciting times 

AVA let's goo!</body>

  <body>So I was supposed to do a DD on 9SP over the break and post it earlier today, hoping it would have the same effect that my AV1 DD had where it got several mentions in the daily thread and then opened with a bang the next day.


However, it's my birthday today and my parents have flown interstate, and it's the first time they've seen my kid since he was born a year ago. So been pretty busy catching up with them. I did browse hotcopper a bunch of times to see if I could rustle up a quick bullet point summary but... I don't understand 9SP enough just yet and I still have my order at 2.5c partially filled so kinda ok to hold off but at the same time, if you all want to jump on and meme it again, be my guest 🤣</body>

   <body>Is the share price going to go up just because they start selling something that was announced ages ago?

Since the potato and gravy deal was announced, PFT lost a third of its share price.</body>
   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="WingsAndRuin001" created="2021-01-04 04:15:06+10:00">
    <body>PFT didn't lose a third of its share price because of announcing that 😂😂 

PFT has such little shares, only approx. 1% of the total shares available are being sold on the sell side but lately only 0.002% of shares are actually trading hands each day. So it's at a really awkward point and can fluctuate quite a big in terms of %gain and loss over a day due to low volume at each price line. People don't want to sell this low, but people don't want to / can't buy it either. If someone wanted to buy $50k worth, they'd run through several price lines and could move the stock 10%+.

Also, one of the catalysts for it dropping so drastically was from bigger fish selling out some of their shares (in larger parcels) at market and also due to the global issues a few months ago when people panic sold. 

Interestingly on one of the bigger green days PFT had last month, 100% more shares traded hands than the average of late. So my guess is that FOMO will bring in a lot more buyers once the SP starts moving like it did last month and then the SP will really jump up due to the low volume of shares. Will an individual announcement on potato and gravy achieve that? I don't know. I'm actually torn, I want it to jump up, but I also want to accumulate another 5000 units below $1 if possible 😂 

Honestly, I'm really excited for the Annual Report this year. Daly Potato's is going to make them a lot of money (not just on potato and gravy fyi, they've been getting so many new customers in restaurants etc too). 👌 

But knowing what PFT is doing, how their online order sales have increased over 300% (not including Christmas data which was well and truly up and they've only just listed on RedMart which should be huge too!!), lots new customers, ready made meals coming in this year, potato and gravy, the input of automated machinery and the fact they still have $2.5 mil of the IPO money sitting there waiting to be used (likely for another factory but it should also mean no need for a CR) makes me bullish overall on the company and I have a lot invested now, and I'll keep investing, especially at these prices.

Eventually the SP will move, but as I'm holding for roughly 3 years, I'm not impatient :). My TP for this year though is $4, but I'm really hoping it does better than that!</body>
    <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="SAIUN666" created="2021-01-04 06:24:08+10:00">
     <body>I agree the fundamentals are great, but I don't feel like a price move from here is inevitable when it already moved so much last year. Surely a lot of these future new products and increased revenues are priced in.

People not buying at the current price isn't exactly a mystery, it's because it's slid down to a fair value after an overshoot on hype. People will start buying again when their perception of the company's worth changes. Releasing products that have already been announced won't do that.</body>
     <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="WingsAndRuin001" created="2021-01-04 06:56:06+10:00">
      <body>Priced in? Not at all. Their revenue is increasing drastically, and it will reflect in their annual report and that will be what drives this stock, not announcements. 

Price is definitely undervalued if you understand and know about the company truly. However when it hit its ATH last year, I'll agree it was overvalued at that date. A fair value based on November sales is $1.27, see my maths below.

Further, with a company like PFT anything they announce can't truly be "priced in" because it's not a sales contract, as in it's not like a company saying we have generated this contract which will earn us $XXX. PFT could earn stacks, or not a lot over every product on any given month. So when the first potato and gravy sales figures are released, I'd agree with you then in saying it was priced in, but for now definitely not yet. Particularly as we don't even know what supermarkets it will be released in yet.

Plus we don't even know what their ready made meals will look like, how many there will be or where they will be distributed, yet that's been announced. So you can't tell me you also think that's priced in? Based on what? An infographic of a concept design of what one of their ready made meals will look like? 

Based on your reply, overall, I don't think you know what you're talking about. How much research have you done on PFT? Or are you just speculating?

In November they did $2,662,547 in (unaudited) group sales. Assuming 10% of that is profit, so $266,254 and a PE ratio of 20 which I think is pretty fair based on the growth and similar companies, and then divide that by the amount of shares on issues, then in November a fair share price was $1.27. 

$266 254 (profit) X 12 (months) = $3 195 048
$3 195 048 X 20 (PE Ratio) = $63 900 960
$63 900 960 / 50 000 000 (shares on issue) = $1.27

The revenue will have increased from November based on they are also selling their product in new places as of December such as RedMart and Aussie Buy Now so their revenue is likely to go ballistic this year because of what's coming up in the pipeline. So it's definitely undervalued right now.

Also in the last two weeks they've put out two job adverts because they need more staff based on how fast they're growing. So I think a TP of $4 is actually reasonable for this year. :)</body>
      <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="SAIUN666" created="2021-01-04 07:45:17+10:00">
       <body>&gt; we don't even know what supermarkets it will be released in yet.

Coops already said Woolworths ages ago.

Both the AGM and the quarterly showed increasing revenues and neither were able to arrest the slide of the share price down to where it is now.

I think it's a bit hopeful that a future report showing yet more increasing revenues will suddenly turn the ship around. People know the revenues will keep increasing for a while. That's why it's 5x in price in the 8 months since IPO.</body>
       <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="WingsAndRuin001" created="2021-01-04 08:00:23+10:00">
        <body>He said two supermarkets and then he said 1 does X sales and the other does X sales of hot chickens. So yes, we can assume it's Coles and Woolies but I don't remember him confirming that as it would be price sensitive? 

Yes, both the AGM and the quarterly do show increasing sales yet but the SP hasn't recovered from the huge sell outs by a few bigger fish who were selling out some shares at market and acknowledging 300% gains. It wasn't a huge sell off by lots and lots of people, just a few bigger investors so it's not really a huge concern in the long term especially as they didn't sell their entire positions in PFT either.

There is a difference between "knowing" and seeing actual audited data. Bigger investors will likely be waiting for the next annual report before deciding to invest because they don't just YOLO $50k+ into stocks. They do proper DD and a lot of that will come from the Annual Report.

PFT is full steam ahead, regardless of the SP, and eventually the SP will catch up. But for now, it's definitely undervalued. :)</body>

Expect a surge on open, as always the case when directors buy on market. I feel like something is cooking, as there's a lot of confidence from the directors over the last few weeks.

  <body>MEG and BSX, upcoming drill results due anyday, will be buying more tomorrow of each. 

KGN if it crosses vwap tomorrow, cooked it on my call on Thursday as l got cocky and didn't look at TA. 

VRX could get interesting this week. At all time highs and fundamentals are awesome.

FYI - huge broker upgrade on target share price. Nice Volume late last week.

CRO - for a tick.

       <body>Channel 7 or 9 had a 4-5min segment during prime time TV a few weeks ago explaining the new test, it’s benefits over existing tests, which stage it was at and mentioned Rhythm.

   <body>It's off that fudged up announcement that makes it seem they banked $8m clean. In reality they have to deduct Crowd1's portion, operating costs as well as taxes before declaring the net gain off it.

Plus a large chunk of it is off their annual subscriptions (70% i think?) which are one and done in this quarter and won't reoccur in the next 4C's after this one.

Didn't think it still had this much life for pumping and dumping though. How often do masochists like getting burned?</body>
   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="slothonreddit" created="2021-01-04 12:54:05+10:00">
    <body>I'm not clear on this part but does all their money go through Crowd1 in the first instance. How likely is it that Crowd1 just ghosts them when it's time to collect?</body>
    <comment ups="4" downs="0" author="hades086" created="2021-01-04 13:19:51+10:00">
     <body>The implication seems to be they get the receipts off the platform (the 8 million in this case), adjust for any running costs and relevant taxes which we have zero idea what they'd be, and then from the net leftover they pocket 66%.

The big question is how much will Crowd1 and EM1 garnish off this in costs, and what the drop-off will be now that those annual subscribers have blown their proverbial load for this calendar year.

Just like with DOU and VR1 Mondello knows how to write an announcement.</body>

   <body>I can only say - not only a bagholder stock but a Boomer Bagholding stock. They have their moments but honestly, Bricks and mortar retailers that don't shift to online are doomed. Even those that do make the change have to be exceptional if they are to be selling a limited stock, type of merch, whatever. Will probably fold within 12 months and be restructured - shareholders will get same deal as Virgin.</body>

    <body>How am I bag holding though? I bought it cheap? The premium spaces that Kathmandu lease actually hurt it's profitability, as they shift away from that and shut some of these down they'll become more profitable. The RIP CURL purchase is yet to be realised but these are two of the most iconic brands in this country. Kathmandu for Winter and Rip Curl for summer.</body>

     <body>Sorry, that was more a reference for long term holders. The brands have value but I still expect many retail chains to fold if they rely on physical store sales. Corner stores are almost gone. Online is in its infancy and will only get bigger. Stores are competing with products from across the world that can be found and purchased online. Also, if the stores' online platform is terrible then being online won't help.</body>

     <body>Being the largest collation of data in the music industry id imagine to run analysis to track down which specific musos and genres of music attracted the most audience and produce the most revenue for music producers, venues, platforms or advertisements. Even music industry reporters would use this for looking up artists and researching their background for articles on websites and magazines, I saw billboard crediting jaxsta the other day in an article they wrote about a band. It shows revenue, API deals drive revenue for jaxsta, also hopefully an update on customer subscriptions would be nice to show it's continued scalability. Jaxsta is a global database for the music industry, it shows all the songs musos have worked on or collaborated on so they can be credited (paid properly) this I believe should be single handedly the most appealing thing to its customers, getting credited and paid for anytime your music is played on ads, radio, movies etc. It is also useful for the music and film industry when scouting for producers, song writers, musician's, singer etc. I see it becoming the LinkedIn of the music industry.</body>

     <body>Data = Dollars

API deals involve a business paying Jaxsta an annuity to access/utilise their data.

Example: A digital music provider empowers users to be able to select music from a comprehensive selection of music metadata (provided via the Jaxsta API). 

As these deals are written, JXT MC will rerate by multiples of this future revenue.</body>

  <body>There's no such thing as a blue chip anymore. Fucking Westpac in 0 interest rates, fucking miners reliant on China who will pull the rug out sooner or letter.

There is NO BLUE CHIPS ON THE ASX. I only consider defensive stocks like Coles/Woolies to be 'blue chip' the rest are not worth fucking shit.

So with that said, you might as well gamble...the ASX is a dinosaur. If you think BHP tinto and Commiewealthz bank are going to deliver 8% for the next decade or so you're dreaming!!!!!!!!!!!!

I just tried to join Motley Fool extreme and the website didn't work! Any reviews on this?

       <body>It depends on the ROI and time frame you are looking at. Banks are safe bet for long term and they will pay divs, hence making you money. It's a different story if your definition of 'making you money' is 100% daily ROG(Return On Gambling). 

What happened after the housing bubble popped in 08? Property prices bounced back. 
What about SMEs? Not everyone has family to get loan from to start businesses. 

People need money and people take out loans in good and bad times, banks charge interests on the loans in good and bad times. This is just one way commercial banks make money. Idk what do you mean they don't make money?

Even if banks don't make money they will still be banks and the big ones will likely stay big if not bigger: they are the fucking middle man in almost every transaction we make and they don't provide the services for free, wtf do you mean 'THEY CAN'T MAKE MONEY'? lastly, the gov simply won't let the big banks die easily so they will retain their value for a looooooooong looooooooong time to come and hence they are as blue as your balls.

Are you on crack? I think I've gotta try it at least once in my life.</body>

   <body>Extreme opportunities is alright and had a fair few multi baggers like VVA ($1.20 rec), PBH ($2 rec). However their actual business model is really about pumping stocks which are low enough in liquidity that their recommendations spike the price about 5-15% and that's when they sell out (allegedly).

I'd use a stop loss for anything they recommend and never buy on the day because it's going to temporarily dump back down the next 2-3 days even if it's a solid company.</body>
