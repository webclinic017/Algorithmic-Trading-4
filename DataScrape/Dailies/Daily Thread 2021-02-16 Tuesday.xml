  <body>The daily threads are becoming unbearable during trading hours. Just a bunch of mindless pumping and rocket emojis combined with a bunch of “what do we think about this dogshit stock that’s already rocketed, should I fomo in at the all time high?” comments.

The after hours comments are much better at least. More actual discussion and not just pumping and fomo.</body>

Check my recent history for some DD (not all positive) on COB, LAK, EMP and BPH as well as an explanation of T+2. 

It just feels like a cocktail umbrella in front of a firehose hooked up to a sewerage tank.

Edit: this came across as more woe-is-me than I really mean but I’m going to leave it.</body>

  <body>Started out today with an absolute atrocity of a hangover, had a heated argument with the toilet bowl at the gym, went to work at my shitty uni job to earn back what I blew on the weekend.  Absolutely hating my life and regretting everything I'd ever done until I checked my portfolio after 4. Lo and behold my portfolio is up a whopping 12% and at an ATH. Would have taken me months of saving to put away what I ended up with today. God it feels good to be able to say that. Still two ours left at work. Might have another spew. Fuck life is good</body>

  <body>Hi all,

As requested by the moderator of this reddit section u/phantom_hax0r, I posted when I bought a stock today.

BD1 at $5.2.It has sharply fallen to 4.2 in just 1 hour. A 20% loss.

**My track record continues of buying at the absolute peaks and watching the prices plummet drastically in the following period. I am available for employment to make you money from my horrendously bad timing.**</body>

   <body>I reckon they would’ve known how much was there before they bothered paying to move all that equipment in, unless they’re run by children I would assume a survey would be done prior to any expenses of equipment and setting up rigs, the fact they’ve set it all up and ready to go should say something. It’s long because American public holiday and then Wednesday morning is US Tuesday arvo so makes sense... or maybe I am completely wrong</body>

I will be but a humble countryman who grows potatoes in a yard and spends the days with a flair of calm ambience and a state of serene tranquility. Enjoying life without the toxicities of modern technology.
And if XST goes wild I go wild and I can actually buy proper food. We party to the moon and fuck shit up.

  <body>LRS - what a beast. Looks like they paid some marketing mob with shares so hoping there’s something big on the horizon. 

JXT - back to where we should be. Ready to test  12c and beyond.

VRX - super bullish on this fucker. Took some off the table today when I really should’ve added 🤦‍♂️

IXR - cap raise but sounds like it was oversubscribed and wasn’t too discounted. Could be good.

SGC - will be saying my Hail Marys and praying to the stonk gods results are good.

FYI - management fucking retail good, maybe.

New positions, NWC and SRN.</body>

  <body>I’ve done some digging on BD1s recent tag team of announcements. Disclosure - I hold this stock.
I know very little about investing so I won’t give any incorrect information about what I think will happen to the price.

On 11/2 we got the announcement that the Sub-B2M test showed promising results for Ovarian cancer detection. Commenters pointed out that a familiar sounding publication with exactly the same numbers of participants in each arm was published in Nov 2018 in a paper called “Detection of N-glycolylneuraminic acid biomarkers in sera from patients with ovarian cancer using an engineered N-glycolylneuraminic acid-specific lectin SubB2M”

The data in this study shows 100% sensitivity and specificity for stage III/IV cancer, however on looking through the data characteristics there are multiple patients with stage I and II cancer who have levels lower than some of those in the “normal” group. You can see this in appendix 1. 

The investor timeline sheet states that the SubB2M tests were developed with disease monitoring in mind. Is that because at this stage it was only really showing good differentiation between advanced cancer and no cancer?

It is unclear if these are the same serum samples, or if they used the exact same number of samples to give the calculated amount of statistical power, however the original article does not mention how they came to choose the numbers in their sample size. If it is the same serum samples, could it be they have improved the test and it’s new data on the same samples? Did they improve the test from their 2018 study so that they were getting a clear differentiation between stage I and II cancer and healthy controls? Is this why they are now saying early detection potential?

Today they dropped a similar bomb with their breast cancer blood test. 
The announcement states that the results were presented at the Lorne Cancer meeting in 2020
I’ve found the text summary of the accompanying poster which does not have any data - can be found here: http://cancer-2020.p.asnevents.com.au/days/2020-02-14/abstract/69005#affiliation_58500

On BARD1’s webpage we can see they submitted this article to a journal in May 2020 - it is yet to be published. 
Perhaps COVID got in the way, perhaps it was slowed due to the need to time publication with other announcements, perhaps the editing back and forth is just taking a fairly long time - I don’t know.

I think this is an exciting development, but it is incredibly preliminary and as investors we actually know very little about the data used to generate the numbers in the announcement, or at least how it differed from their 2018 study. 
While there’s an amazing amount of hype and especially for a product which could benefit so many people, a healthy level of skepticism is necessary and I’d be keen to see more results or data, or hear others thoughts. It’s also important to point out that there remains zero media impact on all of the above developments, other than stock market coverage. 

Tomorrow will be very interesting</body>

Kudos to you for doing some actual research and realizing that there are still so many unanswered questions, especially from someone who is holding this stock already. The fact we are still left to guess how this trial is different to their 2018 one, which by the way got very very little traction with the wider scientific community (a whopping 2 citations!), has to raise some eyebrows. 

Like you said, did they just tweak their methods around the same set of serum samples (given that the numbers of cancer and not cancer patients from the 2018 trial is identical, this seems likely)? Is there curve fitting going on to produce these better results (as in, working backwards knowing the results they want to get and tweaking the method to get to those results)? Are they no longer using the CA125 biomarker which is known to give false positives on women with a bunch of other non-cancer conditions? Of those 22 non-cancerous women in the sample, do any have those conditions that usually trip up testing? 

I'm guessing 99% of people who bought into the stock lately have not even considered most (if any) of these things we've raised. They saw the 100% announcement, saw the hype/stock rising and fomo'ed in. And now they're pretending to be experts pumping the hell out of it on HC, claiming this will be a multi billion dollar company in no time with certainty and just helping feed the frenzy.

Instead of clearing the things up we've raised, we got another announcement yesterday for another type of cancer which boosted the hype around the stock in this fomo market to brand new levels. You would also think mainstream news, reddit, anyone aside from stock sites, would've picked up on this major breakthrough in cancer detection, yet i am still to see anything, 5 days after the initial announcement. I'll be watching with interest/amusement to see what happens next.</body>

  <body>Anyone else feeling a bit lost in the market at the moment? The water is choppy, im struggling to figure out any discernable tide. Recovery sectors have lost steam. O&amp;G are still depressed. The lithium craze came and went faster than the fame of a 2nd place Australian Idol contestant. It feels like the herd is  floating around aimlessly, just piling into the next meme stock that happens to pop.

Yet with the global fiscal &amp; monetary policy environment we currently have i can't help but stay bullish. I'm not buying any more until i can figure out wtf is going. Just gonna sit about 80% invested and hope for some momentum behind AV1, WZR, 4DS, PEN, etc...</body>

   <body>I’m transitioning into a full free carry portfolio as the green has almost hit all of my initial sell targets, I’m bullish short term but I don’t even know what I’m bullish on - mid to long term I’m expecting a crash and I want liquidity so that I can reenter some companies I missed out on at desirable prices 

I think trying to perfectly time the market is a fools game but anticipating changes and being prepared to hold on through turbulence is a good strategy in this market 

TLDR - I’m only selling at my price targets and preparing for at least a mini crash this year where I’ll buy in again</body>

  <body>☢☢☢  Uranium Recent News &amp; Movers        ☢☢☢

**PEN** has cracked the 16cent mark with a strong base behind it. More than triple the buyers than sellers but a still bit of a lid between 16.5-18 to push through.

**BMN** completed an institutional capital raise last week with A$12mill raised within hours of having order book open. No retail SPP which is a bum but also positive because raise was over and done with within 1 day and price has gone up since. The last time they raised money was 3 years ago, so they no how to spend it sparingly.

**LOT** brought on a new managing director. Still wondering if there is something going on there and if Edward Smirnov resigned for "other opportunities" or was he pushed out. Either way new guy has been involved with LOT since inception and was the instigator to buy the Kaylekera mine back last year.

**DYL** completed their PFS and rolled straight into DFS following great results. As part of they have now kicked off new exploration drilling of [700-800 holes to prove up the other half of their JORC resource](https://economist.com.na/59182/mining-energy/deep-yellow-commences-drilling-project-in-erongo/) that hasn't even been included in any study as yet.

This morning **DYL** announced trading halt for a **capital raise**. It is unsure how much and whether they will go same route as BOE and BMN and raise straight off funds/instos or offer some to retail - where it can drag out longer but throws us plebs a bone.

**Capital Raises: BOE, LOT, BMN** and now **DYL** have all raised money in the last 6 months - most regarding pre-feasability study advancements and others with mines for restart studies and optimisation works.  I will keep an eye on PEN for a potential raise, though they have A$8mill in the bank and contracted income so it doesn't seem as necessary.

**Globally** the uranium sectors have been getting some significant tailwind and big strong growth. Canadian and US markets are steaming ahead. Hoepfully some latency between US and ASX results in some more steady moves on ASX over the next 2 months       ☢☢☢🐂📈💰👌</body>

  <body>So as a take away from the VML Ann today this little bit of info I like.

"It is noted that cerium typically accountsfor approximately 50% of the total rare earth oxides contained within bastnaesite mineralisation."

I like this part since we are selling our REO ex Cerium we are looking at a 50% increase so our 5000t's would be 10000t's to a normal RE supplier.

If you are looking short term we still have to break the trend but looking at long term this is great news if we get up to 5000t's for our 1st Offtake that's roughly $250mil profit shared In the profit scheme.
In 2022 SRC will have their Seperation plant online in Canada which VML will most definitely be feeding also which could increase it past 5000t's per year.</body>

  <body>**UNI:** Finally sold for around 26% profit. Solid company but I think at these prices AVA is a better buy/hold.

**3DP:** Contemplated selling today, though the company is too promising when considering the potential of its partnerships and how much revenue they can bring. Already up over 200% on my original holding so not bothered if the price goes down over the short term, I'll keep on holding.

**AVA:** Bought another parcel @ 60c, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't expect the company to hit $1 some time this year. As I've previously mentioned, the company has phenomenal fundamentals and seem to always reward shareholders via special dividends.</body>

   <body>Well tomorrow is permissible just for an independent confirmation of the *size* of the resource - it says nothing about it's *composition* nor ease or otherwise of extraction.

Confirmation of the size is certain to cause a price jump but it's not the whole story.

There is drilling underway to see what they actually have - is the gas usable gas or full of garbage which needs removal? Is it at a high pressure, allowing for a decent revenue stream from the sale of it? These are questions which the first drill will answer - probably next Monday. If the initial drill (the "spud", for some reason) is positive this will release the bulk of the share price potential raise.

Then, ask the same questions again because there are another 15 segments beneath the first segment which also need to be drilled. This process will take approximately 35 days, and it is likely that there will be updated as it goes along. These will allow incremental changes to the share price.</body>

  <body> Hey mofos,

Some helpful copypasta info on XST from a HC thread. It’s actually useful. Take it as you will and DYOR.

“I think our minnow XST has aspirations of becoming a Mid Cap one day based on what has transpired over the last six weeks. I say this for three reasons;

1) Oil Project Acquisitions  
 

\- announced a 15% interest in the Red Earth oil project. The Operator has estimated that the infrastructure alone would cost $100's millions of dollars to replace.  
 \- announced a 10% interest in the Alberta Plains oil project. The Operator has estimated that the infrastructure alone would cost $150m to replace.  
 \- from these two acquisitions alone XST now has 1.5m of 2P oil reserves on it's books with further development potential  
 \- have advised that they are also currently considering some extremely attractive oil investment opportunities that have been made available in recent weeks

2) Borba  
 

\- drill is now fully funded and working interests have been finalised  
 \- XST took the strategic step to increase its interest to 33.33%  
 \- multi TCF well. Independent resource assessment due any day.  
 \- nearly two kilometres of prospective interval  
 \- 16 stacked target zones  
 \- GJ has said it is the most anomous piece of seismic he has seen in the basin to date etc.  
 \- 3D seismic shows that Borba is 'significantly' larger than Alvares on 2D seismic. Alvares has been estimated at 2.4 TCF.  
 \- spud expected within a week or two  
 \- XST has a 24% interest in other areas along trend from Borba which could be part of a new 'fairway'.

3) Relentless Buying  
 

As i have posted previously approx 2bn+ shares have been bought in the last 6 weeks, the buying in XST has been relentless and demand insatiable since mid December. There was even another 113m shares bought on Friday worth approx $1.2m. A massive super soak has been taking place imo.

[https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/big-drill-target-big-buying.5881703/?post\_id=50587004#.YB4fVU8\_WDY](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/big-drill-target-big-buying.5881703/?post_id=50587004#.YB4fVU8_WDY)

Now if a fair proportion of those shares have gone into 'tight' hands, and with alot if newsflow expected which could be company making over the next few months we all know where XST could be headed, the upswing could be parabolic imo.

I believe this is big players that have been getting set due to the first two points that i have raised and also what i raise further below.

If you are in doubt that a significant rerate is possible, consider the following three companies as an example;

1) Paladin (PDN) - have the Langer Heinrich mine, was around 0.006c at one stage and shareprice ended going to around $10

2 ) Oxiana (OXR) - was trading under 1c, purchased the Sepon copper gold project in Laos from Rio Tinto, shareprice went to around the $1.50 mark.

3)  Independence Group (IGO) - floated at 20c, purchased the Long Nickel mine from Western Mining at a time of rising nickel price.  Share price went to around $9.”</body>

  <comment ups="11" downs="0" author="Mutated_Cunt" created="2021-02-16 08:01:09+10:00">
   <body>Timmy wants 10 crayons but he's a stingy cunt and only wants to pay 4 apples. Kevin sees Timmy is fucking dreaming, but will sell Timmy 6 crayons at a shit cunt price of 4 apples. This means the surplus volume is 10 - 6 =  positive 4 crayons.

On a different day, Timmy already ate enough crayons, and only wants to buy 3 crayons for four apples. Kevin realises eating his crayons makes him retarded like Timmy and wants to sell 10 crayons at a price of four apples. At market open, there will be 3 - 10 = negative 7 crayon surplus volume.</body>

  <body>**VRX** is moving along again, hopefully test 40c leading into offtakes. 

**CLT -** Pretty interesting price action today, looked like a fund playing with the tape and scooping up everything. A great half yearly may send this much higher.

**XST -** I fomod in for a trade now I'm stuck for better or worse, goodluck chums, I'm going to get cucked if it's sub optimal news.

**AVA** \- My largest holding and although slow performing, I feel like this is actually a great stock to be accumulating. Extremely bullish long term outlook.</body>

LOT, PEN, RLE, hoping they move more before close. Also wouldn't mind a bump in BMN.

Looking at buying into DTS, currently @$0.18, worth a buy around $0.165 - $0.18, they have some fantastic projects and funding at the moment. Potentially a midterm hold but the potential for at least a bag, might do some DD and post it up</body>
