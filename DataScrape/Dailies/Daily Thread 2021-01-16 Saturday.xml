   <body>ANP - shot up 60% last Friday to close at 20c. And today it closed 21c. Dunno what all hoohah and panicking was about this week. Oh yea, my $10k t2 at 22c... Oh well, a third broker report came out this week saying it's worth at least double current price so 22c will be worth a few pats on the back soon.


AV1 - at least drop down low enough for me to buy the dip. Stop loss hunting bots took the day off I guess. u/imhifunctioning cum dance for me baby.


9SP - someone look at that course of sales and tell me what they're looking at.

      <body>Read the chart mate. Cup and handle, textbook. Same thing happened at 8-9c just a few months ago.

We have big news events imminent too. Major seller is out, chart is primed. Its perfection when you see it.

Measured move gives a 29.5c target initially. Will go higher off the back of successful trial results. :)</body>

   <body>Question for the QPM researchers. Isn’t most of there nickel holdings laterite nickel? My understanding is laterite nickel isn’t appropriate for battery grade metals and you need sulphide instead to create better battery cathodes?

Edit: I got my answer so there using a refinery method to produce nickel laterite into nickel sulphide.

Couple things to mention for people on QPM.
They don’t and probably won’t get a Tesla contract with there tonnage and material available let alone plant capability. Due to what Tesla has said there looking for this type of nickel is not the answer to there manufacturing and prototypes hurdles.

They are also not a “green” nickel miner as everyone is saying.</body>

     <body>The thing I like about here is we call bullshit without becoming hotcopper. I look into hype to see occasionally if stocks are worth a swing trade. Here’s what I found so far.

There MOU with LG is for more than what there PFS states there mill is projected to be capable of.

Milling laterite ore of low grade requires a lot of refinement due factors such as arsenic content. This already low grade ore is well below 1% nickel. The more refinement equals the more cost associated with to create the require sulphide project. As refinement occurs you lose more nickel content from original product leading to your raw product becoming diluted. This isn’t a new concept. It’s been attempted before unsuccessfully not once but multiple times. 

Tesla requires for its vehicle components a viable large source of nickel sulphide that operates to a sustainable method of mining. They need medium grade nickel sulphide for cars and some small amounts of high grade &gt;2% for proposed trucks to implement there idea. Nickels price is climbing to new highs due to multiple factors, it’s not a finite source and magmatic nickel ore bodies are not easy to find but they are valuable due to there high grade contents of massive sulphides and are easy to mill reducing the major costs associated with producing a raw to a usable product. This also depends on factors such as there arsenic content which if it’s low the more valuable that resource is. What Tesla don’t need is a supply chain that Is unsustainable through a companies PFS which can’t deliver the demand nor the product required to make its vechicles.

The stage QPM are in is an expensive process for setting up this type of project. Which to me means potential more dilution of shareholder value. Of which this has happened quite abit.

There quarterly report also suggests they have cash problems and quite abit of debt. 

Hype: twitter and HC have been pumping this one abit latley. Something I think should be factored in to people’s judgement on how to trade it.</body>

      <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="Phishbaron" created="2021-01-17 15:55:35+10:00">
       <body>I actually see nickel dropping in price short term due to surplus. A couple things to watch is the situation in Indonesia where an export ban is in place for encouragement to develop smelters to sell a higher grade product. Also keeping an eye on manufacturing demand of stainless steel products as COVID reduced the need for manufacturing and freight channels affected demand supply.

Also just to add on QPM the leeching process used is called HPAL. It’s really intriguing and has many positives compared to other methods of extraction but capex is spoken about in the billions not millions.</body>

   <body>Looks like Tyro is done. Even if the company sorts out the EFTPOS terminal failure, many merchants will have swapped to a new terminal provider by then. Probably go the way of Babcock and Brown. When news comes out that is materially damaging to a company - time to bail. When it lifts the suspension and resumes trading,it won't be pretty.

When its extremely hot and things burn down, people lose their damn minds.

  <body>ANP - shot up 60% last Friday to close at 20c. And today it closed 21c. Dunno what all hoohah and panicking was about this week. Oh yea, my $10k t2 at 22c... Oh well, a third broker report came out this week saying it's worth at least double current price so 22c will be worth a few pats on the back soon.


AV1 - at least drop down low enough for me to buy the dip. Stop loss hunting bots took the day off I guess. u/imhifunctioning cum dance for me baby.

We have big news events imminent too. Major seller is out, chart is primed. Its perfection when you see it.

  <body>Question for the QPM researchers. Isn’t most of there nickel holdings laterite nickel? My understanding is laterite nickel isn’t appropriate for battery grade metals and you need sulphide instead to create better battery cathodes?

Edit: I got my answer so there using a refinery method to produce nickel laterite into nickel sulphide.

Couple things to mention for people on QPM.
They don’t and probably won’t get a Tesla contract with there tonnage and material available let alone plant capability. Due to what Tesla has said there looking for this type of nickel is not the answer to there manufacturing and prototypes hurdles.

They are also not a “green” nickel miner as everyone is saying.</body>

   <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="Phishbaron" created="2021-01-17 14:04:46+10:00">
    <body>The thing I like about here is we call bullshit without becoming hotcopper. I look into hype to see occasionally if stocks are worth a swing trade. Here’s what I found so far.

There MOU with LG is for more than what there PFS states there mill is projected to be capable of.

Milling laterite ore of low grade requires a lot of refinement due factors such as arsenic content. This already low grade ore is well below 1% nickel. The more refinement equals the more cost associated with to create the require sulphide project. As refinement occurs you lose more nickel content from original product leading to your raw product becoming diluted. This isn’t a new concept. It’s been attempted before unsuccessfully not once but multiple times. 

Tesla requires for its vehicle components a viable large source of nickel sulphide that operates to a sustainable method of mining. They need medium grade nickel sulphide for cars and some small amounts of high grade &gt;2% for proposed trucks to implement there idea. Nickels price is climbing to new highs due to multiple factors, it’s not a finite source and magmatic nickel ore bodies are not easy to find but they are valuable due to there high grade contents of massive sulphides and are easy to mill reducing the major costs associated with producing a raw to a usable product. This also depends on factors such as there arsenic content which if it’s low the more valuable that resource is. What Tesla don’t need is a supply chain that Is unsustainable through a companies PFS which can’t deliver the demand nor the product required to make its vechicles.

The stage QPM are in is an expensive process for setting up this type of project. Which to me means potential more dilution of shareholder value. Of which this has happened quite abit.

There quarterly report also suggests they have cash problems and quite abit of debt. 

Hype: twitter and HC have been pumping this one abit latley. Something I think should be factored in to people’s judgement on how to trade it.</body>

     <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="Phishbaron" created="2021-01-17 15:55:35+10:00">
      <body>I actually see nickel dropping in price short term due to surplus. A couple things to watch is the situation in Indonesia where an export ban is in place for encouragement to develop smelters to sell a higher grade product. Also keeping an eye on manufacturing demand of stainless steel products as COVID reduced the need for manufacturing and freight channels affected demand supply.

Also just to add on QPM the leeching process used is called HPAL. It’s really intriguing and has many positives compared to other methods of extraction but capex is spoken about in the billions not millions.</body>

The huge positive of these idiots doing what they did is that no one can trade shares for the next four days so it gives them more time to fix it.

  <body>What are people’s thoughts on Tyros issue?

Is this an opportunity for competition? Is this time for our favourite CRO code to take some of their customers??

Or is this just a small blip?</body>

   <body>If the shorters report is correct, and over 50% of terminals are bricked, then they are fucked

Not to mention the reputational damage, why should a small retailer stay and risk another hit to their livelihood, when they could move to a big 4 bank 

Saying that, if it tanks much more I'll probably buy because their transaction increases period on period have been insane</body>
   <comment ups="8" downs="0" author="kervio" created="2021-01-16 23:34:53+10:00">
    <body>These shorters are kinda hacks, they publish outright lies to drive stock prices down. I'm waiting to see what Tyro has to say, but the stories from merchants don't match up to the report from viceroy.

This is a good piece: https://www.intellidex.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Intellidex-Report_Investment-Research-in-the-Era-of-Fake-News.pdf

The viceroy aim was to heavily short the stock on the bad news about the terminals, publish the piece, then heavily short it a bit more and then buy back before they fix it, a smash and grab. The trading halt over a weekend gives Tyro 4 days to:

* Reply to the viceroy BS stats (claiming 50% with no proof doesn't line up with Tyro transaction volumes published, for example).
* Fix most of the problems so they can say "all resolved now!" Before shares are back online
* Crystal for customer compensation and repairing trust.

If they pull all that off then viceroy are fucked on their shorts. If they don't then they kind of deserve to get maimed (and I hold shares, so that's saying something).

They were smart to suspend trading.</body>

     <body>The company will try to paint a rosy picture but 2 weeks after the problem, very few terminals are sorted. Do a few google searches or bookface. It is not pretty</body>
     <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="kervio" created="2021-01-17 19:41:17+10:00">
      <body>Well let's see what they say. I wouldn't trust those viceroy guys as far as I could kick them, and plenty of early evidence suggests nowhere near 50% of terminals were down (Tyro transaction volumes up, plenty of reports from people I know saying they were not affected, facebook complaint rates declining). 

It'll be a drag on sales because they've had their name raked through the muck, but nearly 50% drop in market cap seems overblown looking at the financials and growth.</body>
      <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="timbuckley66" created="2021-01-18 09:40:02+10:00">
       <body>You may be right. I don't think it was 50% of terminals either but I also don't believe what the company says - ie - it's under control/sorted etc. Figures will be impacted and they will lose merchants over this - that may pull up their growth target. Generally, when bad news hits a company, it takes awhile for everything to come out into the open.</body>
       <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="kervio" created="2021-01-18 10:01:29+10:00">
        <body>Did you see the weekly update? Transaction vols up for the week YoY. There's no way it was even close to 50%.

Some drop is justified for sure, but not this halvening of market cap.</body>
        <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="timbuckley66" created="2021-01-18 10:53:58+10:00">
         <body>I am looking at the weekly update now.It doesn't make any reference to the outage which I think is strange. I just can't get excited about a stock that hasn't kept up with the market in the biggest bull run in years. It set up for a breakout after the june to oct 2020 consolidation and then failed that to the downside. Who knows where support is.</body>
         <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="kervio" created="2021-01-18 11:02:35+10:00">
          <body>The weekly update is a standard format update they do every week regardless of any news etc. Their issue update will be tomorrow. 

This market hasn't been a bull market for face to face businesses, so their profitability and growth hinges on bricks and mortar retailers reopening and face to face transactions resuming.

I don't think technical analysis really applies to a stock in the middle of a shorter attack, but you gotta do you, and I respect that.</body>

  <body>Trying to figure out my next 4 purchases on Monday, what do you guys think?

1. QPM, fully decided on this one, green metal stocks seem to be doing great. Made a killing on COB and SYA last week, hoping to get more more exposure that this phenomena. 
2. EMN, same reason as above but not sure if it has much higher to go? Would be happy to hold long term. 
3. CRO, just cause I want something outside of mining. Not fully committed yet, wondering if it has much further to go?
4. INF VS LKE, more lithium! But can't decide between these two.

2. Not too late... This is like a long hold, talking years. 
3. Can’t say, don’t know about this. 
4. Neither. Go CXO.
5. PEN clear choice for me, DYL was close second. PEN is the only asx listed stock with a mine in the states. I think securing local strategic supply of U has been put up high on Biden’s to do list. There was a good DD on uranium and PEN had the most 🚀 next to it</body>

   <body>Don't think ASB is a dog, but it's political. Reliant on govt defence spending. Not everyone wants to build more ships.

LYC has had an excellent run (I'm up 80% since Sep), short term it wouldn't surprise me to see it catch it's breath and consolidate. I have confidence it'll grow in the long term though.</body>
