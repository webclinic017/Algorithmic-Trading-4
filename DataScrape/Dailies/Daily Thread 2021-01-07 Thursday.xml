   <body>Jesus, have a look at DKM - I know people here don't give a shit about P/E ratio, but a *1.9* ratio on a penny with an 88% annual return is pretty insane:

       <body>There's a big sell wall at .22c. There's 2 things that can happen:

1) we rally up to .22 but we don't break that wall. If this happens, we will either hover around .20 - .21 , until the wall breaks , or , until people panic sell back down to the .18c mark again (if we could see into the future and knew this was going to happen, it'd be smart to sell at .215 and then buy back in at the dip at .18c . However , if it goes up to 30c after we sold at .215 were going to be upset).

2) we break the .22c wall and we hit 30c . If this happens , we won't be seeing the SP under 20c again 

We have to monitor closely on the day and make our choice on the day. I absolutely have faith in HT8 , so im not scared about losing my money long term. Its just whether you want to swing trade with it to potentially make more money than just holding (sometimes this can backfire, or it can work in your favour. Its pretty much luck)</body>

       <body>It just ran from 9c-17c. So a bit of profit taking. They just announced the first of 4 offtake agreements. About to announce tax breaks from the government, resource upgrade from drilling (400mt currently - 1.2Bil tonnes potentially...(PLS has 280mt), FID to follow. A lot of eyes on this stock!</body>

   <body>I did a quick Google and found the BRN ASX Announcement. On reading it, why Barry Marshall is part of the SAB is evident. For 1, SAB stands for Scientific Advisory Board and Barry Marshall isn't talking about AI, rather the use of its applications in Medical and Virology research.    

From the Announcement:.   

"The SAB was established to provide BrainChip with leading insight to the application of Artificial 
Intelligence across a wide spectrum of use cases including Smart Health. Smart 
Health is a branch of healthcare where neural network technology, medical and virology research 
meet to enable new intelligent technologies to deliver the rapid interpretation of clinical tests.    

“As BrainChip focuses on the commercialization of its groundbreaking AkidaTM AI technology the 
Company believes strongly that Smart Health is a market of great importance with regard to 
improving the human condition and providing best-in-class technologies to support the worldwide 
need for advanced healthcare”, said Louis DiNardo, BrainChip President and CEO."</body>

   <body>I think the generic answer would say have a punt on battery materials. So usual suspects like rare earth, copper etc. I also feel its been pumped and dumped so hard after tesla battery day that i would hesitate in backing one horse. Perhaps a play on an utilities company thats already heavily invested in green generation? If america goes green, the pressure would be massive for australia to be more climate friendly.</body>

      <body>There's a big sell wall at .22c. There's 2 things that can happen:

1) we rally up to .22 but we don't break that wall. If this happens, we will either hover around .20 - .21 , until the wall breaks , or , until people panic sell back down to the .18c mark again (if we could see into the future and knew this was going to happen, it'd be smart to sell at .215 and then buy back in at the dip at .18c . However , if it goes up to 30c after we sold at .215 were going to be upset).

2) we break the .22c wall and we hit 30c . If this happens , we won't be seeing the SP under 20c again 

We have to monitor closely on the day and make our choice on the day. I absolutely have faith in HT8 , so im not scared about losing my money long term. Its just whether you want to swing trade with it to potentially make more money than just holding (sometimes this can backfire, or it can work in your favour. Its pretty much luck)</body>

  <body>NVX - a good time to buy this little dip? What's their correlation to the current battery trend seeing they deal with graphite and not lithium?</body>
  <comment ups="5" downs="0" author="WistfulWhiskers" created="2021-01-07 12:38:27+10:00">
   <body>NVX is in a great position for cheap synthetic graphite production and they have ties with Tesla both directly and indirectly.They've currently got an agreement with Samsung for \~500 tonnes of graphite and a non binding agreement with Sanyo (Who creates the bulk of Tesla's battery cells) which is just a start IMO.Talga is also an excellent bet as they're currently in stage 1 of a 3 stage plan to produce \~60,000 tonnes of pure graphite py (valued $9,000 per tonne sans production costs)to put it in perspective, Tesla alone will require something in the range of half a million tonnes of graphite anode over the next decade in Europe aloneTalga is \~500+ times more environmentally friendly than the average Chinese plant (China being one of the main supplies of Graphite presently) and their graphite is 9x as present in the material they mine as opposed to China's

To compare the two; NVX gross profit is 8000 ($1000 lower) per tonneBoth of these companies are going to explode over the next few years.  


NVX is in a much better position in terms of production speed and actual market capitalisation considering their qualification process is 11 months vs 18 months for Talga and they already have various agreements in place.   
Talga has much higher quality material with a much lower cost however their financial foundations aren't in the same place (hence the recent capital raising)</body>

  <body>AFL - how about that 18% jump today aye? After my DD yesterday? Aye? Aye? Counting it. Although you guys really need to pay attention to u/NocturneHS when he posts a DD.


AV1 - someone told me they looked at broker data and it showed Wilsons bought 500k shares at 19c recently. Feels good mang.


9SP - I swear to god, if I'm not the new Melvin if/when this hits 7.5c in 6 months...


ANP - either go low enough so I can buy under my average, or go high enough so I can feel good about my gains. Don't need this half limp dick shit.


IHL - same as ANP. Pick a direction but sideways!


CDT - settled my T2. Am told to wait for an easy 1 bagger in the short term based on TA and other goldies doing well. Am also told broker data shows insto buying. Closed at my buy price of 1c so let's see how it goes tmw.

    <body>I bought back in September. Sold yesterday. Took my profit and put it into elsewhere.

QAN was never a long term hold. No dividends, huge government bailouts and them sacking employees left and right made them an undesirable long term hold anyway. They've had their run. Maybe in 2022 when international travel is back up fully they'll have another run but even then, planes are expensive and revenue is far and few between</body>

   <body>If I was going to throw a rock at **XRO** it would be because of two things;

82% of their revenue comes from outside NZ. Globally, small businesses are falling off a cliff, that's a revenue hit for XRO.

The other is the NZD is gaining strength against USD/EUR so I'd guess reported earnings will decline.

Just guessing.</body>

**CCR** \- Automating credit collection comms, reducing op ex for enterprises and the team/investors are worth betting on [https://www.creditclearlimited.com.au/#our-team](https://www.creditclearlimited.com.au/#our-team)

Now give us yours.</body>
   <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="ASisko" created="2021-01-07 16:30:51+10:00">
    <body>I will add KSS to my review list. 

Currently my most promising stock in the speculative category is CBR. UWL also looks pretty good but I’m leery of the model. Harder to wrap your head around and be confident you got it right.</body>
    <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="tao_of_bacon" created="2021-01-07 21:18:44+10:00">
     <body>Nice, I’ll have a read of CBR. High-end design and manufacturing could be a winner. 

UWL in the other hand is a miss for me, dark fibre and NBN-ish business models just sound capital intensive.</body>
     <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="ASisko" created="2021-01-08 13:50:28+10:00">
      <body>Took a quick gander at KSS this morning. Would you agree or disagree that they can essentially be classified as 'space infrastructure', with all the implications thereof? High capital investment in the hopes of a revenue stream that pays back what you put in? Does not seem like a massive growth opportunity to me, just a matter of whether or not the revenue streams outstrip input costs.</body>
      <comment ups="1" downs="0" author="tao_of_bacon" created="2021-01-08 21:41:49+10:00">
       <body>Disagree.

KSS offers zero space platforms, payload delivery, rockets, robotics or any infrastructure to support other companies getting their stuff into space.

For classification, they'd go in 'Satellite Imagery and Data' along with their main competitor, pre-IPO [HawkEye](https://www.he360.com) based in Virginia USA or privately-held player [Unseenlabs](https://unseenlabs.space) based in Europe like Kleos.

Micro-satellite surveillance is quite new. Just two months ago the US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency put out their first request for vendors to monitor ships globally using RF. I'd bet on HawkEye to win it.

Kleos' primary opportunities are South China Sea, the Japan Sea, the Strait of Hormuz and the Australian coast. Secondary opportunities are in Saudi Arabia and Chile. But they are also pursuing the US.

So there you go, KSS is the only publicly traded opportunity in this game if you want to play.</body>
