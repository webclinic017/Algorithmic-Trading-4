    <body>After all this time I‚Äôm not holding my breath. Still in and still a strong believer but the one thing this company has taught me is that you can‚Äôt listen to their timeframe estimates re the appeal.

Not that it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs fault mind you. But it‚Äôs just going to take time. I saw some stats the other day about how many mining / exploration / etc applications were backlogged in SA bureaucracy and it was harrowing.</body>
    <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="Dark_Raiden_" created="2021-03-09 20:03:20+10:00" sentiment="TIP 5">
     <body>Yeah I saw that post too. Are you bullish on the outcome? Further delays is something I won't be surprised about at this point, but the potential outcome itself is not too concerning for me. What amazes me about this company is the sheer capping the jurisdiction issue is doing. A 4.37Moz 3.88g/t gold mine going into production this year and a market cap of $100M. The potential that the MR sign off has is absolutely massive imo.</body>

      <body>Yeah that‚Äôs more or less how I view it too. Part of the play is a bet against sovereign risk which increases potential return if it pays off. I‚Äôm as confident as I can be given the circumstances and happy with the risk/reward here for sure. I have around 10% of my ‚Äúbets‚Äù portfolio in here.</body>

APT &amp; Z1P are two of the only exciting new innovative mainstream companies on the ASX.  People are sheep and they rarely call the news instead of following it.

   <body>My thinking is DW8 maybe goes down a little tomorrow and through the week, because surely the rise today was due to the monthly update?

Then it'll go back up once b2b launch happens later this month/next month?

     <body>Good unexpected news can light a rocket though. The question is, is this jump due to an unexpectedly good month or is it a confirmation to those sitting on the fence that now is the time to buy before the b2b launch? 

Personally I don‚Äôt really care. DW8 is a long hold for me, deano knows what he‚Äôs doing, all I have to do is sit back and watch his success make me money.</body>

  <body>Legitimate question, why use BNPL services? 

My girl just bought a new pair of Jordans and wanted to use a BNPL, I just told her to just use my credit card and pay me in how every many allotments she wants, provided Its in my payment cycle. She chose 4 payments so we just devided the price by 4 and set an autopay.

What's the bonuses of doing it like this? Well I get flyer points and she gets a shit ton of consumer protection and product insurance from my credit card. Are either of those things offered by BNPL services? 

If not... Why not just use a credit card? Is it the negative rap they seem to have gotten? Is it people don't trust themselves? Or is it perhaps more preditory as BNPL don't often require background credit checks and thus are likely to be favoured by those who regularly miss payments anyway.</body>

   <body>Because, you can Buy Now and Pay Later? 2 months to pay it off on Afterpay for example vs what could be 1 day before you could incur interest on a credit card?</body>
   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="luner124" created="2021-03-09 18:14:07+10:00">
    <body>Typically You have 30 days on a credit card to pay it off before interest accrues. 

And afterpay still makes you split your cost into 4, which typically you would pay off each week as that's when people are payed.

     <body>The interest can start accruing from your [missingword] date, so it could be up to 30 days or it could the the day after you buy it. It's a fixed monthly date, not a rolling month. This was explained to me by the bank after an unexpected interest charge.

   <body>Depends, where do you sit financially? A lot of people arn‚Äôt stable, maxed out credit cards but are still stupid enough to buy things. That‚Äôs BNPL market. 

I personally use it regularly when I can despite being stable.  If I‚Äôm purchasing something over $200 or so, being able to split the payments up between two pay checks can be handy some times because I don‚Äôt want to dip into savings but would rather budget for some of the cost the following month pay.

Also mentality, people would purchase more than normal knowing they can split the payments up. Much easier for low income earners to pay $25-50 a week or fortnight then it is to save up $100-$200 and then purchase.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs predatory market, people should educate themselves but to your point, a lot of it would be around trusting themselves as with a credit card the interest is nominal on a few grand per month, but the rates back on missing those payments would be rough.

I just personally don‚Äôt see how any of them are very going to turn a profit so would never invest in BNPL services</body>

   <body>If you don't fully pay off your credit card you get hit with with high interest fees on the remaining balance, but BNPL stuff doesn't have interest (tho there are late fees if you don't keep up with payments). That's my understanding, at least.</body>
   <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="luner124" created="2021-03-09 18:18:24+10:00">
    <body>Ok I understand that in theory, but one of my side gigs is in private lending. I used to do 5% interest loans but quickly found you make a shit ton more money doing 0% interest and instead charge late fees.

Afterpays late fees are $10 on loans as small as $41 so your instantly hit with a 25% fee straight away that gets exponentially larger the more missed payments you make.

It's pretty comparable tbh</body>

    <comment ups="3" downs="0" author="FameLuck" created="2021-03-09 18:33:01+10:00">
     <body>As soon as possible. I went through my watch list over the weekend and couple days and eliminated all but 4 (from about 15) bought into 2 today, CHK halt so couldn't get in, and the 4th option is a bit expensive, but I'm hoping to start reducing my portfolio and putting a lot of money into it when it next dips.

So I'm hoping to get in shortly after the announcement, assuming it doesn't rocket before I can... Although I did put the money I allocated for it into LRS today</body>

   <body>After all this time I‚Äôm not holding my breath. Still in and still a strong believer but the one thing this company has taught me is that you can‚Äôt listen to their timeframe estimates re the appeal.

Not that it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs fault mind you. But it‚Äôs just going to take time. I saw some stats the other day about how many mining / exploration / etc applications were backlogged in SA bureaucracy and it was harrowing.</body>
   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="Dark_Raiden_" created="2021-03-09 20:03:20+10:00">
    <body>Yeah I saw that post too. Are you bullish on the outcome? Further delays is something I won't be surprised about at this point, but the potential outcome itself is not too concerning for me. What amazes me about this company is the sheer capping the jurisdiction issue is doing. A 4.37Moz 3.88g/t gold mine going into production this year and a market cap of $100M. The potential that the MR sign off has is absolutely massive imo.</body>
    <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="catch-10110" created="2021-03-09 20:07:10+10:00">
     <body>Yeah that‚Äôs more or less how I view it too. Part of the play is a bet against sovereign risk which increases potential return if it pays off. I‚Äôm as confident as I can be given the circumstances and happy with the risk/reward here for sure. I have around 10% of my ‚Äúbets‚Äù portfolio in here.</body>
