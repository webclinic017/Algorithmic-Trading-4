   <body>EGR (EcoGraf) has been ticking all the boxes lately, successfully raised 54m and held support at CR price. Allianz participating in the CR raise and buying 5%. US listing due any day now, Volkswagen Power Day tomorrow, potentially a very big week for EGR, just my humble opinion</body>

     <body>I believe this is a similar scenario to the NVX Tesla Battery Day, but instead EGR and VW Power Day, maybe just to a lesser extent, although will be great for overall awareness on the importance of renewables and recycling battery materials,  just my humble opinion</body>

        <body>I can't think of it off the top of my head but I'm sure I came across it, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find digging into some of Egr's articles on their website.   


Indeed was a nice entry at 8c, and I've have been topping up ever since.</body>

   <body>LRS: hold. 🚀🚀🚀 

MNS: hold. 🚀🚀

HWK: hold. 🚀

There's still a large amount of LRSOC unexercised so I'm expecting some sell-side sp pressure/drip dilution for a while to come. Overall prospects still solid though, and if Lithium and Gold projects are fast tracked and show potentially high yields and economic production then we are sweet. 

MNS I'm happy to not have any news if it means they're focussed on getting that gigafactory set up quickly!

I forgot why I bought a parcel of HWK 🤔

Good luck all!</body>

     <body>If everything is exercised, listed and unlisted, it's around 1.9b shares. So I'm factoring in a dilution factor of 31% over 2021 which should be easily countered with a single 🚀 worthy update from either the Lithium, Gold or Kaolin project. In fact the recent dips might already have the upcoming options priced in since investors expect this dilution.</body>

   <body>ECS - comes off trading halt with hopefully a good CR, can't wait to see where to from here.

BRN - buyers will be stacking at current SP especially with the addition of BRN to the ASX300.

Let's hope we all get a good start</body>

    <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="peaandham610" created="2021-03-14 19:23:28+10:00">
     <body>ECS will tend upwards regardless, great business, acquiring Murray Meds was a solid move, and unlike most Pharma stocks it didn't get a pump previously so it's good to have a consistent trending stock. With that said, I don't doubt it'll be pumped at some point, I'll also welcome that.

BRN have made some amazing advancements recently, the Nasa Phase 2 announcement will be welcome news, and with the Nanose and Sniffphone work recently there is so much upside. The issue they have is the cant announce much until they can provide a concise statement of the impact it'll have, and that'll take time.</body>

Even the annual report didn't shine a bright light on BRN...dont get me wrong i also hold the stock and see the future potential but no real progress yet on this front it seems...</body>

  <body>Another day of high hopes for XST is upon us. 

Twitter, Facebook , Hot copper and of course Reddit has been a circus of anticipation and anxiety over the last few weeks. Fellow retards who have already pre-planning lambos are cringe but loving the energy. I do hope to upgrade from my shitty 2011 mitz lancer. 

Tomorrow I honestly believe will be the final nail to fucking send this to 3c+. I don’t know what else XST can do to get the market to wake the fuck up. 

There is gas down there and it will be broadcast out to the market soon enough. Due to the proximity of the gas reserves, chances are that two - three Trading halts could happen before the end of next week. 

I am salivating at what the final drill results will contain. 

Diamond hands are well are truely on 💎🙌 

CRL.
As per CRL activities report, funding has been secured and drilling is to start Q2 CY - which will be April . Gold price is garbage at the moment but don’t be deterred by the beast that is the Santa Teresa tenement in Mexico. 
This will rip once a further announcement has dropped.

    <body>Hard to put a number on it but I love the diversification that CRL possess. With Graphite , Gold and copper interests, They’re well equiped for a decent run in 2021.

Due to the severity of Mexico’s corona virus outbreaks, CRL would be best to focus on their Aus tenements. IMO

Ticks all the boxes for me 😎</body>

 I wonder how many drugs that save humans have had to lab test on animals. 

Let us see PETA staffs loved ones die to curable diseases companies have created based on animal testing

Humans are always going to be more important than animals.

Mix 4 table spoons melted butter, salt, pepper, garlic, Italian herbs.
Put tattos and mixture into baking dish.
Chuck dish in oven - bake 20 minutes.
Flip tattos - bake 15 minutes
Make a cup of vegetable stock, flip tattos poor stock on - bake another 20 minutes.
Grate cheese, bake 15.
Eat the tattos.

HWK: hold. 🚀

There's still a large amount of LRSOC unexercised so I'm expecting some sell-side sp pressure/drip dilution for a while to come. Overall prospects still solid though, and if Lithium and Gold projects are fast tracked and show potentially high yields and economic production then we are sweet.

   <body>One of my mates put 10k into them about a month back. It’s been pretty up and down but Friday treated him well.

I’ve heard stories of 88E management being in a cycle of promising and not delivering from other members here, can’t provide evidence though sorry mate (unless someone else has a story)</body>

      <body>That's pretty solid, he'd have 12.5m shares which would now be worth 13750$ I'd say hold on for Monday but sell half before results for the 1500m within a week ( It should comfortably reach 0.0014-6  with the current hype by Monday, but may drop as peeps take profit in tuesday), or at least sell 10k worth and keep the rest in imcase Dave's actually reliving the bhp story. 99% aren't in for the oil story. They are in becoz there are KFC deals to be made if you time Ur trades throughout the hype</body>

  <body>ECS - comes off trading halt with hopefully a good CR, can't wait to see where to from here.

BRN - buyers will be stacking at current SP especially with the addition of BRN to the ASX300.

   <comment ups="2" downs="0" author="peaandham610" created="2021-03-14 19:23:28+10:00">
    <body>ECS will tend upwards regardless, great business, acquiring Murray Meds was a solid move, and unlike most Pharma stocks it didn't get a pump previously so it's good to have a consistent trending stock. With that said, I don't doubt it'll be pumped at some point, I'll also welcome that.

BRN have made some amazing advancements recently, the Nasa Phase 2 announcement will be welcome news, and with the Nanose and Sniffphone work recently there is so much upside. The issue they have is the cant announce much until they can provide a concise statement of the impact it'll have, and that'll take time.</body>

  <body>Hey guys I'm looking into BPH, LRS and RAC. I know they're all pretty well popular but not sure what would be best. Have about 5k total to invest  anyone else on these?</body>
  <comment ups="12" downs="0" author="tynub89" created="2021-03-14 20:55:22+10:00">
   <body>How long you holding for? BPH is at discount but very risky, RAC has consistently mooned but I'm cautious about biotechs, and LRS imo is the safest bet of the three due to its diversified portfolio in halloysite/lithium/copper/gold. More reports due every week.

If it was my money I would put it on IXR as its current price is very discounted 0.048 and also there is a resource report coming at the end of this month. Last report showed a trippling of the estimate and rare earths are in play due to the Chinese supply issue. Also take a look into LTR/NVA which are gold+lithium plays with both having reports due early next month.</body>

  <body>Is anyone hyped at all for 88E? Last friday up 37.5% and trade volumes approx 668million! But there doesn't seem to be much love on here for Dave Wall; or is he just waiting for some Amazon oil barrel delivery to Alaska so he can fake it on the first 1500m with Merlin-1? You'd think after 5 failed searches, the permafrost &amp; water's gotten to his head by now? Desperately wondering what's going on up there.. is that oil from somebody's lunch or is that 1.6billion barrels of tears?

We are transitioning into non hydrocarbon based life I think, but there will be a demand as the change hasn't happened yet - but a lot of companies are looking forward

  <body>Reading DLC's forum on Hotcopper is pretty fucking funny, it seems like even people who hold it can't work out what they actually do 😅

   <body>Interesting article about the new DDD no.1 shareholder. Quite a run he’s had with resource penny stocks. He’s also no2 ADN shareholder with a stake now worth $17m (at $0.37 share price, I think he was in at $0.005-6, same price as DDD now)

Given his record not the worst to be following for a punt

   <body>Nothing has changed fundamentally between last Monday and this Monday, yet the share price is up 100% because of some email pumpers. It's still a med tech company which the sector is renowned for incredibly slow uptake.

This can only end well. Basically if you're that keen on this company, you wait for it to die, then you buy and wait for the next email pump as a part of their "investor coverage" and sell the hype.</body>
